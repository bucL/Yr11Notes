## Paragraph 1 -- Shakespeare and Race 
---
- **Start Paragraph with a comparative study statement!**
	- Use words from the module
		*- Reframing, Reimagining, 
		- Intertextual Conversations.
		- Dialogical Relationship* 
	**- EG. "Sax extends Shakespeare's representation of ___ for a contemporary by ___ "**

- Diminish his sense of self, psychological implications. It erodes his trust in others, particularly his wife and ultimately it leads to a tragedy, to **death**
- Values esteemed by Shakespeare
	- Racial tolerance and respect for others. 
- Make sure that it is thesis, context the evidence. 



## Paragraph 2 - Sax and Race
---
**Thesis**:
- How and why Sax reframes the idea of Race
	- Link to the value of racial tolerance, the need for it, through this he is responding to the facade of equality in society
		- We pretend that there is equality when there is not. 

**Context:**
- Response to that came out of the 1981 Brixton Riots. 
	- Get specific evidence from the film → Racial Inequality and Racial Discrimination.
	- The Juxtaposition → cutting between the police function that is almost all white and the riots that are occurring on the streets. 
	- White Police Force Function:
		- Exemplifies the Xenophobia of the society, the false narrative that’s perpetuated about *Racial Equality*, Then use what the commissioner says “its not about race“, more promotions for the police force, dramatic irony. 
	- Bashing of Billy Coates
		- Brutality of the actions taken by the police the disjunction between what the police commissioner says and what happens to Billy Coates. 
	- Postmodern challenge the dominant cultural narrative about race. 

**Sax challenges the dominant Cultural Narrative of Race**
- That we live an equal and non racist society. 

- Esteeming that we need to recognise the truth as if we don’t it goes underground → more insidious. He is esteeming justice and truth, honesty and integrity.
- 
- Last piece of evidence used in Sax paragraph must by the close up of Ben Jago becoming police commissioner and have to then link that to the way that Sax is reframing the play. 

- The person who perpetuates the racist ideology of the society is the one in the end who ascends to the highest position of power. 

**Sax does what he does to champion values of tolerance honesty and justice**:
- Pretends to be a postmodern society that pretends to be one of equality when in reality it is a corrupt society of racial inequality. 

Despite the narrative that we have progressed society we in truth haven’t. In fact today it is probably worse because sax exposes **institutionalised racism**


## Paragraph 3 - Combined Gender 
---
- Patriarchal Ideologies
	- How they objectify women and put them in vulnerable positions. 
	- Patriarchal Ideology comes from male dominance. 
	- Perspective or the view that women are sexual objects. 
- Reimagines how Shakespeare’s play sees women and objectifies them. 
- **Shakespeare shows us that women are vulnerable and ultimately powerless in a society where men dominate society**
- The narrative of gender that we see within Shakespeare’s elizabethan context positions women as the other who are ultimately placed in a state of vulnerability, even though at times we see them at times they have agency, however the narrative of gender is so strong that ultimately they are powerlessness which is exemplified in the plays’ tragic form as they die. 
- Sax reframes this notion of gender for his contemporary postmodern society, one where he exposes that ironically despite affirmative action (third wave feminism) women are still in positions of powerlessness and vulnerability
- He also comments on domestic abuse, when women are seen as objects it is easier to treat them as possessions and treat them as such. 
- Last sentence: *Gender Inequality Still Exist* → Patriarchal narratives continue to diminish the power of women while bolstering the power of men, affirms the continued relevance of Shakespeare’s play. 

> This is how women are viewed, how this patriarchal narrative makes them vulnerable to men. How it seems in Shakespeare’s play despite the time they have some agency but ultimately they don’t
