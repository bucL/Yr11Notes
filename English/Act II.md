##### How does Act II commence the chain of events that will lead toward the tragic events in later Acts?


##### Consider how Iago, as a trusted member of Othelloâ€™s staff, is able to manipulate all those around him? How is he able to maintain such influence?
Iago is able to maintain such a position amongst Othello's staff through his machiavellian nature and the duplicity in which he treats those around him. 

##### How is he physically able to commence his deception?
He is able to commence his deception while they are playing word games and playing off his suggestive comments as part of the game itself. 

##### What weakness does he target in each character?
Iago exploits Cassio's focus on courteous manners and attentions to exploit his emotions and force him into a fight reducing his worth in the eyes of Othello. He targets Desdemona's trust in him to target her as shown through his cynical behaviours and views of women "Bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens". 

##### Which characters are most culpable of allowing Iago to commence so much discord in Act II?
Desdemona and Cassio allow Iago to commence his path of discord through their misplaced trust and generally high opinion of the other. 

##### Given what you know so far about Iago and his wife Emilia, how functional would you expect their relationship to be?
Given what we know about Iago and Emilia's relationship and Iago's doubt in Emilia's faithfulness with him we expect their relationship to be less than functional and more just a show to keep all involved satisfied.
