# Consolidating Power
---
> [!idea] Describe 4 ways Castro consolidated power in Cuba.

Immediately after gaining power Castro solidified his hold and sway over the general populace by introducing reforms that he himself had advocated for before he rose to power. He implemented an education reform that made a drastic difference on the population as before the revolution **23.6%** of the Cuban population was illiterate, by **1970** illiteracy had been reduced to **4%** and there was a serious uptake in the number of secondary schools and university enrolments. He furthered this approach by taking significant steps to improve healthcare and the quality of life for Cuban citizens. Doctors were redistributed across the country as **64%** of them were concentrated within Havana leaving little support for the rest of the country. He introduced a free health service and started a massive inoculation program which reduced infant mortality from **60 per 1000** live births to **15**. Rents were cut up to **50%** for low wage earners, the telephone company was nationalised and raters were reduced by **50%**  land was redistributed amongst the peasant populace and seperate facilities for blacks and whites were *abolished*. Castro held huge sway and influence over the president and the cabinet and often used this to further advances in the nation's wellbeing. Furthermore, he removed anybody that previously belonged to Batista's government and still was in a position of power ordering executions, imprisonments and a retrial for a group of pilots that had been found not guilty by a judge handing them a **20-30** year prison sentence.

## Creation of a Communist State

- **Land Reform** was one of the principal objectives of the regime. 
	- Farms limited to a maximum size of *1000* acres. 
	- All properties over *1000* acres were expropriated by the government and redistributed 
- These reforms **alienated** Cuba's powerful elite and US companies operating in the country and further fuelled fears of Communism. 
- The influence of the Cuban Communist Party increased in the Provisional Government:
	- By mid **August 1959** a number of anti-Castro plots were uncovered.
	- Growth of internal opposition increased.
	- A number of former revolutionaries sentenced as *"counter-revolutionaries"*
		- **Hubert Mato** - 20 year sentence - *"Anti-revolutionary conduct"*.
