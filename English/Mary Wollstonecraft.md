# Mary Wollstonecraft — A Vindication of the Rights of Women

- Like Rousseau she is concerned with social injustice but specifically in relation to women. Written in reaction to the repressive patriarchal ideologies of her time that denied women the same rights as men
- Influences Women’s Movement and her ideas continue to be relevant.
- Patriarchal Society women rights.
    - Interested in addressing injustices that women faced because of patriarchal ideologies. Women are viewed as inferior to men as objects to be handled around.
    - Rights men inherit automatically at birth while women do not.
- She contrasts and compares women to soldiers and men that serve in the army. Makes her argument by drawing a connection between soldiers who are the most esteemed people in society directly to women saying they are not so different from each other.
- There is practically no difference between the manners and actions of soldiers when compared to women yet their status in society is elevated above all.
- Men have been elevated by society and therefore tyrannise their sisters, daughters and wives because they believe it is their right and they are superior.
- **Her argument is to strengthen the female mind by enlarging it, giving women education and end blind obedience.**

After considering the historic page, and viewing the living world with anxious solicitude, the most melancholy emotions of sorrowful indignation have depressed my spirits. . . . I have turned over various books written on the subject of education, and patiently observed the conduct of parents and the management of schools; but what has been the result?--a profound conviction that the neglected education of my fellow-creatures is the grand source of the misery I deplore, and that women, in particular, are rendered weak and wretched by a variety of concurring causes, originating from one hasty conclusion. The conduct and manners of women, in fact, evidently prove that their minds are not in a healthy state; for, like the flowers which are planted in too rich a soil, strength and usefulness are sacrificed to beauty; and the flaunting leaves, after having pleased a fastidious eye, fade, disregarded on the stalk, long before the season when they ought to have arrived at maturity. One cause of this barren blooming I attribute to a false system of education, gathered from the books written on this subject by men who, considering females rather as women than human creatures, have been more anxious to make them alluring mistresses than affectionate wives and rational mothers; and the understanding of the sex has been so hobbled by this specious homage, that the civilised women of the present century, with a few exceptions, are only anxious to inspiring love, when they ought to cherish a nobler ambition, and by their abilities and virtues exact respect. . . .
