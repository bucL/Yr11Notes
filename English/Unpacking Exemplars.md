# Key Points from Markers Feedback
---
- For Sax  need to analyse film techniques rather than language conventions. 
- Need to have clear discussion of these techniques and their effects on the film
- Don't just take quotes from one part of the text try and use multiple quotes from different parts of the text to demonstrate your understanding
- Use the tragic form and its conventions to guide responses. 
- Need to consider the shift in context's and time periods between the two texts and how this impacted each play. 

## Exemplar responses analysis
---
- The paragraph's start with links between Shakespeare and Sax -> comparative. 
- outline the form of each text in the thesis, eg. Shakespeare's Aristotelian tragedy. and sax's film. 
- Key words to use 
	- Xenophobia
	- Egalitarian facade of racial equality
	- Patriarchal society
	- Feminist postmodern context. -> oppression of women as demonstrated in Shakespeare's Othello, women can hold moral and marital agency yet are suppressed by the Elizabethan Patriarchy
	- Despite the shift towards equality and the women's rights movement that spread throughout the world women are still objectified and regarded as less than men. 
- **Facade of sexual and racial equality** present in Sax's film that demonstrates the lack of true progress that has been made. 
 - Shakespeare is restricted by his theological and political context. 
 - Racial Inequality is another key factor that should be thoroughly explored within the essays.
