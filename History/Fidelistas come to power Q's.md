> [!quote] ##### This time Cuba is fortunate: the revolution will truly come to power. It will not be as in 1895 when the Americans intervened at the last minute and took over our country ... It will not be as in 1933 when the people believed the revolution was in the making and Batista was in power ... It will not be as in 1944 when the masses were exuberant in the belief that they had come to power but thieves came to power instead. No thieves, no traitors, no interventionists. This time the revolution is for real!
> -- Fidel Castro addressing the people on 1 January 1959

##### Questions:

1. In this speech Fidel clearly outlines and states that this time around when the revolutionary groups come to power they will not be held back by external forces, a corrupt government nor from traitors and interventionists rather this time the Revolution will and already has succeeded and the people of Cuba will have their destiny in their own hands. 
2. The Source reveals the power of persuasion for the Revolution when Castro says "when the masses were exuberant in the belief that they had come to power but thieves had came to power instead" demonstrating the importance of persuasion and how anyone was able to gain control and influence the people with the right tools of persuasion.
