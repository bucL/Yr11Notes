###### From the Moncada Barracks to the Sierra Maestra:
- From the outset of his rule Batista faced an active and diverse opposition. The major political parties leftist "Orthodoxos" and more moderate Auténticos adopted a variety of approaches. 
	- Orthodoxos quickly organised underground cells and a campaign of propaganda, street demonstrations, strikes and sabotage. 
	- Auténticos originally adopted a political stance but soon converted to a more militant one. 
- Fidel was one of the most active Orthodoxos organising cells and publishing an underground paper called **El Acusador**. 
	- He was also an Orthodoxo candidate for a congressional seat in the aborted election. 
- He first achieved prominence as a result of his attack on the Moncada barracks. 
	- Failure and resulted in half of his forces dead while almost all of the rest were captured including Castro himself. 
	- Gave his "*History will absolve me*" speech in front of the court and while it failed to convince the judges who sentenced him to 15 years in prison the general gist of the speech was spread to the public in a pamphlet. 
- Batista declared a general amnesty in May 1955 in an attempt to support the moderates. 
	- Castro immediately left for Mexico and began raising his own force of military fighters to rebel against Batista.
- Before leaving Mexico he formed a pact with the Revolutionary Directorate(Directorio Revolucionario) an Anti-Batista group formed in 1955 by the University of Havana student federation. 
	- Mexico City Pact of September 1956 -> agreeing to coordinate efforts, reject all compromise with Batista, and, after victory, establish a government based on a nineteen-point program. Castro announced that he would come to liberate Cuba before the ned of 1956. 
- Plan of attack developed in coordination with the 26th of July Movement operatives was to capture the entire city of Santiago, aimed to defeat Batista by shock.

	- His 82 men landed in the wrong spot.
		- Fifteen survived and regrouped to flee into the Sierra Maestra. Rest were killed, captured or dispersed. 
		- Rural Guerrilla warfare was born "out of desperation rather than choice."
- In 1957 and 1958 cities were still the main theatre of war between Batista and the opposition. 
	- Castro was virtually neglected.
	- Batista initially claimed Castro was killed. 
	- Sustenance and safety from army patrols obtained through passive/active cooperation with the peasantry recruited by the 26th of July Movement.

- Herbert Matthews introduced Castro's band to the world in 1957 through the Times newspaper on 24th Feb 1957. 
	- Cubans were able to read about Castro due to a temporary relief of press censorship at the time. 
	- Disproved Batista's claim and greatly helped recruiting. 
	- Second Military Victory attack on 53 man garrison at El Uvero band was 100 men strong.
