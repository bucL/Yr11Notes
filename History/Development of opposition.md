## Marxism

---

Karl Marx — German philosopher who wrote the Communist Manifesto in 1848 with Friedrich Engles. **Capitalist** societies developed rapidly with industrialisation. Marx predicted that these societies would have revolutions in which the **proletariat** (workers) would overthrow the **bourgeoisie** (those running companies etc.) who owned and controlled the wealth. The workers would share the resources equally. Engels and Marx called the sharing of resources **socialism**. They predicted that people would work for the good of all people. The next stage is **communism** where people would work according to their abilities and be paid according to their need. Marx and Engles predicted that society would evolve through revolutions from Capitalist → Socialist → communist, classless utopia.

## Questions

---

1. The Concept of revolution is important to Marx’s theory as it is such a different form of society/government that without revolution there would be no other way for the working class to seize the factories, mines and warehouses from the rich, essentially a revolution was need to seize power. 
2. Marxism was attractive to groups within Russia as people saw it as a way to finally overthrow the rule of the Tsar and hope for a better life. The poor believed that if everybody was equal56they would be able to have more than they did then. 

## Opponents of Tsardom

---

**Two main groups opposed to tsardom can be identified as:**

- Revolutionaries:
    - those believed that Russia could not progress unless the tsarist system was destroyed
- Reformers:
    - Strong critics of the tsarist system who believed it could be changed for the better by pressure and reform from within.

## Revolutionaries

---

## Mensheviks Vs Bolsheviks

---

| Menshevik View | Issue | Bolshevik View |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Russia not yet ready for proletarian revolution — the bourgeois stage had to occur first | Revolution | The bourgeois and proletarian stages could be telescoped into one.  |
| A mass organisation with membership open to all revolutionaries  | The Party | A tight-knit, exclusive organisation of professional revolutionaries |
| Open, democratic discussion within the party — decisions arrived at by votes of members.  | Decision Making  | Authority to be exercised by the Central Committee of the party — this was described as ‘democratic centralism’. |
| Alliance with all other revolutionary and bourgeois liberal parties. 
Support of trade unions in pursuing better wages and conditions for workers (economism) | Strategy | No Cooperation with other parties. 
Economism dismissed as playing into the hands of the bourgeois.

### Why was Lenin unwilling to join a common front against the tsarist government?

---

Lenin was unwilling to join a common front against the Tsarist government as it went against his own internal opinions and being. Even when did join a common front he did so reluctantly and would always attempt to make his opinion prevail through great cunning and determination. For him there was there was a hard line between the people that supported him and those who went against him and there could be no social or personal relationship outside of the two classes. He didn’t want to be around people that didn’t share his views completely. 

## Reformers and liberals

---

Aside from the revolutionaries, there were also those who sough non-violent change. They are referred to as liberals but they do not form a common front. 

**Octobrists**: this group dates from 1905 and are loyal to the Tsar and the Russian Empire as it is. 

**Kadets**: this group also dates from 1905 and wanted Russia to be a constituional monarchy — whereby the Tsar is restricted by a democractically elected national assembly. 

### Describe the nature of **opposition to tsarist rule**

---

Opposition to tsarist rule was largely born of liberal ideas and systems of government in Western European countries, additionally it was also influenced by Karl Marx’s writings in the communist manifesto. 

The Social Democratic Workers’ Party was formed in 1898 but was later split into the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks in 1903. The party was followers of Karl Marx’s writings, and after the split had distinct differences between the two but the underlying ideology remained the same, to start a revolution and throw over the tsarist government. The Mensheviks were more open having no underlying restricitons for new members and sought to have alliances with other parties to improve the strength of the movement against the tsar as a whole. The Bolsheviks were more extremist in their nature in the sense that they demanded that for change to occur they needed an outright revolution instantly and their aim was to turn workers into revolutionaries. They had no cooperation with other parties and economism was dismissed as playing into the hands of the bourgeois. 

Apart from these two parties there were also those who sought non-violent change. They are referred to as liberals but they didn’t form a common front against the Tsar. They were the Octobrists whose name comes from the October 1905 declaration, formed in 1905 they were utterly loyal to the Tsar and the Russian Empire as it was. And the Kadets, this group also dates from 1905 and wanted Russia to be a constituional monarchy where the Tsar is restricted by a democratically elected national assembly.
