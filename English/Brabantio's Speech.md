# Speech to Othello -> Brabantio is Mad
---
O thou "***foul thief,***" where hast thou stow'd my daughter?  
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast "***enchanted***" her;  
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,  
If she in "***chains of magic***" were not bound,  
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,  
So opposite to marriage that she shunned  
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,  
*Would ever have, to incur a general mock,  
Run from her "**guardage**" to the "**sooty bosom**"
"**Of such a thing as thou**", to "**fear**", not to delight.*  
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense  
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,  
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals  
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;  
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.  
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee  
For an abuser of the world, a practiser  
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.  
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,  
Subdue him at his peril.

### Analysis
---
- "foul thief"
	- Objectification of women
	- "foul" -> negative connotations, if you're foul you're vulgar, dirty, amoral. 
- "enchanted", "chains of magic", "foul charms", "practiser of arts", "drugs or minerals". 
	- prejudices of the time, magic. 
	- Brabantio is saying that Desdemona could never have been attracted to Othello unless he'd practised magic upon her. 
- "tender, fair and happy"
	- Tri-colon with contrast to the foul thief
	- Reflected the ways of thinking of the time about women. 
	- Shows he doubts that Desdemona would have ever loved a man such as Othello. 
- "Would ever have, to incur a general mock, Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom. Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight."
	- "Sooty" -> Black, implicating racial epithets. 
	- "Of such a thing as thou" -> Degrading language, dehumanising implying that Othello is not human. We see here the power of language. 
		- Getting a picture of the world and the values that Othello must contend with.  

> [!NOTE] We read this speech differently today and thus it reflects the patriarchal ways of thinking of the time.
