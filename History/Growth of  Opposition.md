    - 90,000 joined the demonstrations - looting and violence.
    - ‘Bread’, ‘Down with the war’, and ‘Down with the Autocracy’

## Key Summary Points

---

1. The February Revolution began as a public strike about food and fuel shortages in the Russian capital Petrograd. 
2. War and domestic mismanagement had caused the transport system to fail, reducing the movement of food especially. 
3. In late February food protests in Petrograd became a popular revolution, prompting the Tsar to dissolve the Duma. 
4. This order was ignored. The Duma instead formed a provisional committee to organise a temporary government. 
5. When soldiers refused the Tsar’s orders to fire on civilians, and his generals refused to back him, he eventually agreed to abdicate. The document was signed in a stranded railway car in Pskov on March 2nd 1917. 

## Historiography

---

**A *historian’s view:***

*“Historians sometimes contrast the February Revolution’s ‘spontaneity’ – the idea that it arose from popular protests without direct political leadership – to the ‘conspiratorial’ October Revolution, which is often described as a coup d’etat. The idea that the February Revolution occurred spontaneously also contrasts sharply with the ‘party line’ in histories published in the Soviet Union, which held that the Bolshevik Party led the masses in the February Revolution. But neither the socialist parties in the new Petrograd Soviet, nor the liberals in the Duma’s provisional committee anticipated that the February 23rd strike would snowball into revolution.”*
