## Recap Russia 1894-1914

---

1. How did religion reinforce the tsar’s authority (church)
    
    The church backed the Tsar’s authority through their demeanor and preaching through which they were a very conservative and backwards church and stated that “God” himself demanded authority to the Tsar from the people.  
    
2. Outline the factors which stagnated industrial development in Russia 
    
    Russia’s vast size and majority of the population being classified as peasants or serfs severely limited its ability to industrialise. The nobility and upper class didn’t provide education opportunities for the poor and as a result in a town there would only ever be the priest and a handful of other people who were literate. Russia’s vast size also limited the opportunity for trade with Europe as transporting materials between locations could take a very very long time. 
    
3. Suggest reasons why a “thriving” agrarian economy failed to develop in Russia?
    
    Russia’s harsh climate was a key factor that limited the capability to develop a thriving agrarian economy with only 5% of the land being suitable for farming and over 80% of the population being farmers there wasn’t much land available. Additionally, Freezing winters and chilly summers resulted in only a handful of crops being able to be grown. 
    
4. Describe the tension that existed between the peasant majority and the aristocrat minority
    
    Amongst Russia’s ruling minority there was a deeply ingrained prejudice against granting rights to those who they viewed as serfs or servants. Over 80% of the population was made up of peasants and the vast majority were uneducated and illiterate. Their sheer size and hard ways of life when compared to the aristocrats made the aristocrats deeply suspicious and fearful of these so called “dark masses” and as a result led to the nobility believing that they were to kept “under a whip” at all times. 
    

## Context

---

Russia was politically, socially and economically backwards at the turn of the 20th Century. Nicholas II inherited an empire best by issues. The absolute power of the Tsar was challenged by the growing forces of liberalism and nationalism and spread through industrialism. 

### What qualities must a leader have to be able to successfully guide a nation through turmoil?

---

A leader must be able to inspire confidence in his people. Have decisive and definitive decision making skills. Have knowledge of the issues on hand. Not rely too much on advisers. Be open to change if something isn’t working.

- Relationship between tsar and people — loving and conciliatory
- Belief that God spoke and acted through him to the Russian people

## Assessments of Nicholas II’s personality

---

> “A man of narrow, special education; of strong and unfortunately - unchanging conviction; of soft spoken, kindly manner; and underneath, of stubborn courage” (Massie, 1985, p63)
> 

> “Nicholas was a weak man, well intentioned and perhaps personally courageous, but weak and there was no strength in him for compromise”
> 

## Issues facing Nicholas II & Russia

---

**Social:**

- Social hierarchy /plight of peasant masses
- Conscription
- Overcrowing and poor condtions

## Russification

**The policy of russification was pursued by Nicholas II** 

→ Adopted Alexander III (Nick’s Dad) and continued

**It is the forced cultural assimilation of the non-Russian national minorities within the empire by emphasisng the superiority of all things Russian.** 

→ Russian is the official first language for all public business. 

**Resulted in a spread of Anti-Semitism**

→ Jews required to live in ghettos

**Opposition to tsarism became more widespread and organised.**
