# Natural Law Theory 
--- 
Natural law is an *objectivist* theory most commonly associated with St Thomas Aquinas (1224 - 1274). It relies on Aquinas; basic understanding that humans innately try to do good and to avoid evil in order to find fulfilment and happiness in life -- by achieving their divine purpose. 

Aquinas argued that *God Created* the **world** according to *Natural Laws* - **predictable, goal-driven** systems whereby life is *sustained*, and everything **functions** smoothly.
