# More’s Utopia

- More’s text shows us an idealistic world and has given to rise to our modern conception of what utopia/dystopia are.
- Contrasts this to his current world where it is profit and wealth driven where greed reigns supreme and people inherit their wealth instead of earning it.
- Value to us today because it has a far-reaching influence throughout time and modern texts.
- Fictitious Text because of the time he is living in. He is beheaded later on for other reasons but he uses it to protect himself from the wrath of the king
- Satirical protest → to get across the opposite which agrees with his values.
