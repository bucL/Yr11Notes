##### Discuss the view that Castro antagonised the US
---
Castro 's antagonisation of the US was the result of the US attempting to stifle Castro into obeying the US and their views on how the Latin America region and the Americas as a whole were under the United States sphere of influence according to the Monroe Doctrine. The United States withdrawal of its economic support of Cuba through the sugar quota and its not so secretly funded attack on Cuba the "*Bay of Pigs*" invasion. Therefore, the US antagonised Castro into making a speech about their failures and broadcasting it to the world as seen in Source A when Castro says "we have destroyed the invasion which was prepared by the brains of the pentagon"., referring to the US's main base of operations. Therefore, the view that Castro antagonised the US can be deemed false and incorrect as it was the US itself that antagonised Castro with an unwarranted attack and resulted in their Public Denunciation.

##### Value of Source 9.16 for historian studying the Bay of pigs.
---
This source is highly valuable for a historian studying the Bay of pigs invasion as it gives a first hand account of the invasion itself and describes the general state of battle present during the invasion.

#### Questions
---
1. This source outlines the course of action from the perspective of a man "Grayston L Linch", and the Bay of Pigs invasion and his attacks against Cuban guerrilla warriors. 
2. Lynch blames Kennedy for the failure of the Bay of pigs invasion as he believes if Kennedy had not called off the air strikes that were supposed to support the invaders they would have had a much better chance at taking over Castro. He also says that he had nothing to feel guilty about when invading Cuba rather he had a score to settle and was ready to take action and see it happen. 
3. This source reveals the strained relationship held between Cuba and the USA and the tension present hat ultimately resulted in the American's sending CIA trained operatives to invade the Bay of Pigs and attempt to take over the country.
4. This might have affected the story to give a biased view more in support of the US's actions and may have watered down the details of the US's crushing defeat to deter any anger from the population. 
5. Lynch blames Kennedy for calling off airstrikes as the downfall of the entire operation. I disagree with this view as even with the airstrikes the Cubans would have been hard to spot or hit with the thick foliage covering the land and the Cubans had an inherent advantage as they lived there giving them a significant strategic advantage. The US could potentially hit their own troops as they cannot distinguish clearly between the different sides in the bush.
