##### How does Act II commence the chain of events that will lead toward the tragic events in later Acts?
Act II marks the emergence of strife and discord between the characters within the play and fully reveals Iago's Machiavellian nature thus setting up the chain of events which will lead toward tragic events later in the play. 

##### Consider how Iago, as a trusted member of Othelloâ€™s staff, is able to manipulate all those around him? How is he able to maintain such influence?
Iago is able to maintain such a position amongst Othello's staff through his machiavellian nature and the duplicity in which he treats those around him. 

##### How is he physically able to commence his deception?
He uses the physical weaknesses of Cassio of alcohol. He inserts himself into he brawl scene to advance his own interests. 

##### What weakness does he target in each character?
Iago exploits Cassio's focus on courteous manners and gentlemanly behaviour to Desdemona to exploit his emotions and force him into a fight reducing his worth in the eyes of Othello. He targets Desdemona's trust in him to target her as shown through his cynical behaviours and views of women "Bells in your parlours, wild-cats in your kitchens". Othello and Desdemona's trust. Roderigo's jealousy. 

##### Which characters are most culpable of allowing Iago to commence so much discord in Act II?
Desdemona and Cassio allow Iago to commence his path of discord through their misplaced trust and generally high opinion of the other. 

##### Given what you know so far about Iago and his wife Emilia, how functional would you expect their relationship to be?
Given what we know about Iago and Emilia's relationship and Iago's doubt in Emilia's faithfulness with him we expect their relationship to be less than functional and more just a show to keep all involved satisfied. 

## Five Key Things from Act II
---
- They all arrive in Cyprus 
- We see Iago's first attempt at trying to get Cassio to believe that Othello and Desdemona's marriage has gone stale and attempts to get him to woo Desdemona. 
- Iago persuades Roderigo that Desdemona is in love with Cassio in order to inspire jealousy and as a result of the subsequent fight Cassio stabs Montano and loses his rank
- Iago reveals that he is attracted to Desdemona is his soliloquy continuing the theme of jealously that is present in the play and his doubt that his wife has slept with Othello. 
- Iago's misgivings about women are revealed and his cynical beliefs and plans begin to unfold.

Starts the decline and the fall of Othello's character. He is going to represent and symbolise the colonial other. 

As he loses the control of his civilised state it will be represented through his use of language. He goes from verse(refined way of speaking) to prose.

His language starts to mirror the language of Iago. We see that two characters that are diametrically opposed they converge as Othello takes on more the attributes of Othello. We see how Iago is infecting the psychology of Iago. 

> [!INFO] Iago is like the friend that you don't want your children to have. 

Othello hangs around Iago is that Iago convinces him that he is Othello's best mate and he always has his best Intentions at heart. 

> [!NOTE] Iago uses exploitation of people's character 

> [!QUOTE] #### All the characters are pawns on a chessboard. Pieces of Iago's game. His weakness is his jealousy and extreme passion

> [!QUOTE] ###### Extreme passion is the "hamartia" fatal flaw for both Othello and Iago

Narratives of race and gender become the tools that Iago exploits in order to achieve his desired end. The Jealousy the extreme pride and the extreme passion are all the motivation. Narratives are built on a binary. They are cultural narratives, they are narratives that shape our culture. 

Shakespeare represents Othello as someone incredibly noble somebody we esteem. his downfall comes through the plotting of Iago. Othello succumbs to the views of society. 

> [!INFO] ### Othello is not innately monstrous, society makes him that way. 

Iago makes Desdemona a woman who is promiscuous a woman who is amoral and having affair. It was terribly for a man's identity, seen as a massive slight on a woman's husband.
