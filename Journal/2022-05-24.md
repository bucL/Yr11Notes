Today was i guess I would say a "*productive*" day.  I got some work done for math, its due this Thursday and i'm about 50% through it though I do have some questions for sir that I wanna ask. I found this new song well spotify found it, it's called sunshine and I feel like I really like it. double art tomorrow might get some marks back for my essay and photobook hopefully it's somewhat good if my VAPD is anything to go by. Maths marks tomorrow, the more I think about it the more I dread getting them back. looked some more into the SAT and found out I can actually take it next year so that's pretty interesting, **MIT?**. Software is going alright. Oh yeah submitted something for TG to read out at assembly about how the school has a stigma around sports like badminton and table tennis don't know if he will read it out or not guess i'll find out on Thursday. yeah well rn just hoping I can do the HSC all right. If not. there's always the SAT to hope for. fingers crossed I actually get a  good score on that. AHHHH the more I think about Maths the more I start to panic so i'm just gonna stop thinking about it and read some reaper before going to sleep today. so bye bye future me who's gonna end up reading this idk like 5 years in the future. oh and before I forget about this #journal
