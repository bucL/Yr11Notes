“When I look back, I am so impressed again with the life-giving power of literature. If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of myself in the world, I would do that again by reading, just as I did when I was young.”

Stimulus quote. 

“The life-giving power of literature” is something that is increasingly realised as being basis upon which today’s society is fabricated. Almost everything we see, hear or do is based upon literature in some way, shape or form. If we look back at Homer’s “The Odyssey”, the same cycle of the hero’s journey that we see repeated in modern texts such as The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings all originated from this one text of antiquity and shaped the lives of many people who still hold them in reverence today. This life-giving power of literature while it may not be evident in your everyday life is truly something that should be held with respect considering that our society is formed upon the basis of literature. Machiavelli’s The Prince is another great example that we can use here as his political treatise on leadership has led to many a revolution and heated debate that has shaped the course of human history to lead you to where you are right now.

As a child I grew up into a family that loved books, cramming anything into our brains into whatever meagre spare that we had . By the time I was eight years old I had read almost the entire Harry Potter series and was well on my way to finishing off Percy Jackson. Up until the time I joined high school, I kept reading and reading and reading. Yet all the time I felt something was missing, it was as if all I would read, was the same story, the same hero’s cycle, with different characters. 

And as I would find out this was true, almost all of the texts that I had read were based upon Homer’s “The Odyssey”, and this cycle of the hero’s journey, of trials and tribulations, of the power of the man over the weak-willed woman. This was true all the while I was reading stories with male protagonists, knights in shining armour fighting for their country. I set myself on a search, a search for why there weren’t any stories that were based upon female protagonists that won their way through on their own with their own strength. 

Quickly into my search I found the history documenting the suppression of women in society, how they were seen as weak, while they were anything but. Mary Wollstonecraft’s text “A Vindication of the Rights of Women” is one that struck a chord within me. At a time when women were frowned upon for being anything but the symbol of beauty and fragility, she turned to the strength of words, the power of literature to impress her perspective upon society and pioneer a women’s rights and equality movement that would last for centuries to come and still continues today.

    Beginning to read at the age of 5 I never really thought much of the activity always avoiding it whenever I got the chance and preferring to have it stay out of the way. While others would be writing stories and reading books I would be whiling away the time doing who knows what just staring out of the window waiting for the torment to end. 
    
    Oftentimes my parents would encourage me to read, taking me to the local library to borrow a book, or buying one for my birthday yet it wasn’t until I entered Year 7 that I finally did properly sit down and read this object called a book. 
    
    Newly coming into Year 7 our prescribed text was More’s Utopia and I had no idea of what to expect coming from a background of having not properly read up until that point. I was completely blown away from both the societal and political of his text and my attitude towards reading began to change ever so slightly. More’s text was the first one where I truly understood the power of literature and it’s implications in our society yet still I wasn’t ready to consider reading a serious adventure and took that as a one off, because surely not all pieces of literature could have that same depth of meaning and relevancy. Could they?
    
    But alas to my despair that was not the case. Each and every day I was continued to be proven wrong by literature. Eventually it came to a point where I gave up and invested myself into books and have since never looked back once. 
    
    Literature has since then helped me gain a sense of myself in this ever changing world and will help you as well if you give it a try. It has this way of creating an everlasting connection between you the reader that can help you make your day to day decisions. 
    
    Truly, I encourage you to read for the power of literature is something that I learnt too little of and too late for me to truly experience a better life. 
    
- previous intro
    - When I first began to read at the meagre age of 5 I never really thought much of it. True while reading quickly became a part of my day to day life I never considered it as something that could shape the rest of my schooling career. Even though my friends took great joy and pride in their abilities to read I often thought of it nothing more than just another strand in the haystack.

> Once you learn to read you will be forever free — Frederick Douglass
> 

In a world that is filled with war, chaos and brutality, it seems that we are increasingly headed into a Dantesque hell. And as we enter this world of horror where are we to turn?

Literature. 

Literature is what brings us together, literature is what can tear us apart, literature is the foundation upon which our world, our lives and our culture is built. 

Literature is gave great politicians, leaders and revolutionaries of the past the opportunity to express their views and to express their opinions on what they knew society needed to do.

Frederick Douglass, an African-American abolitionist once said, “Once you learn to read you will be forever free”. After escaping from slavery in Maryland,USA he went on to lead the national abolitionist movement and served as an inspiration for the likes of Martin Luther King Jr and Rosa Parks who led the 1960s revolutionary movement in the United States. Through his writings and speeches he inspired a whole generation of African-American people to rise up and protest agains their injustice and helped them free their bonds of injustice and inequity. 

Indeed, Martin Luther King Jr’s speech “I have a dream”, remains today as one of the best pieces of writing to be seen, the magnitude of the suggestions he proposed contrasted with his simple
