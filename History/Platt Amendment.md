#### Platt Amendment Source Questions
---
	1. According to the Platt Amendment the US had the right to 'intervene' in Cuban affairs for the interest in protection of Cuba's people and protection from diseases. Additionally, it observes that Cuba will sell/lease land to the United States to install a military naval base in the interest of maintaining independence for the people of Cuba. 
	2. The United States became involved in Cuban political affairs as any decisions made by the country would have a direct impact on the United States due to its strategic position. It also sought to protect its own interests as if Cuba were to be infiltrated or influenced by a foreign national power other than the United States that power could use Cuba's unique position to negatively impact the United States trading routes with the rest of the world.
