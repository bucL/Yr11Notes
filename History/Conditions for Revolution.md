> [!FAQ] Using source A and your own knowledge suggest reasons for unrest in Cuba prior to 1959 

Source A depicts the poor working conditions faced by Cuban peasants population in the sugarcane fields. Their physical appearance and condition is a direct indication to the large disparity between the rich and poor as although Cuba was considered prosperous by Latin America standards the wealth wasn't split evenly. While the rich continued to reap the rewards of trading with the American's many of the poor felt otherwise as they were largely kept in the shadows working only 4 months of the year and struggling to survive. This led to a discontent population that was unhappy with the amount of attention it was receiving as a majority which is clearly displayed upon the faces of these workers with their slouched postures and bent heads.

Source B demonstrates the corruption and terror used by the government to control and extort its people which eventually led to a widespread revolt and revolution. The quote "Batista's regime became increasingly corrupt, dictatorial, and brutal", demonstrates the brutality of the regime and the extent to which it would go to to ensure the continuance of its power. Batista had transformed the country into his own dictatorship after coming to power in a military coup. He suspended all constitutional guarantees and rule by the force of his handpicked police service. "Attempts to find peaceful and legal means to restore constitutional government repeatedly failed... Cuban radicals decided their only choice was armed struggle". This quote from the source provides insight into the state of the people at the time and Cuba's huge disparity between rich and the poor. Even though Cuban Sugar workers were amongst the highest paid in all of Latin America the majority only worked 4 months a year and were paid less than a dollar a day leading to political and social unrest and is a direct link to the radicalisation of young Cubans.
