In 1914, the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II, was in a stable and comfortable position both socially and politically, if not fo the outbreak of the world war it is said by many historians that he may have not been assassinated and killed and rather could have had Russia transitioned to a constitutional monarchy. Despite his lack of quality leadership and resolve Nicholas had with the help of a loyal army crushed the 1905 revolution and subsequent minor attacks on the government thereafter. His advisors and ministers in Pyotr Stolypin and Sergei Witte had helped stabilise and improve the Russian economy. Additionally, the October Manifesto was not a complete hand over of control to the people with the Fundamental Laws being released shortly thereafter and many revolutionary parties and liberals didn’t believe they were strong enough to take on the Tsarist government at the time. Ultimately, in 1914 before the outbreak of the war, the Russian Tsar, Nicholas II was in a stable and comfortable position as Tsar. 

In Spite of Nicholas II’s poor leadership and resolve he had managed to maintain the loyal support of his army which proved to be greatly significant in maintaining control over an increasingly turbulent population. The loyalty his army meant that the aftermaths of events such as Bloody Sunday, where hundreds of thousands of people who marched in a peaceful protest to the Winter Palace only to be attacked and murdered by the army resulting in the starting of the 1905 revolution could be held in check and kept under control. Therefore, increasing his stability as tsar. 

Additionally, through his ministers Sergei Witte and Pyotr Stolypin, Nicholas was able to transform Russia from a backwater medieval like society into something that more closely represented its European neighbours bringing on industrialisation. Sergei Witte’s implementation of the Trans-Siberian railway and financial investments from foreign establishments helped him create an industrial working class and elevate Russia to be the 4th highest producer of textiles after the United States, Britain and Germany. This resulted in what was known as the Russian economic boom as more and more people started moving to cities creating a further increase in Russia’s economy. In Addition, Stolypin’s vast agricultural reforms helped keep the peasant class in check and gain their trust and loyalty and he helped them leave behind their old impractical farming methods behind. Stolypin forced all the peasant class to abandon strip system farming and instead gave each of them access to their own chunks of land. He also reduced their taxes and made education compulsory for all resulting in a growing aspirant peasant class. Royal and Public land was now made available for them to buy and he provided them with a seperate  loan system that ensured that they were able to purchase land. This led to a 6% economic increase in Russia in the year 1913 leading up to 1914. Stolypin’s method of killing any insubordinate citizens was also a reason for the large success of his program, killing thousands who spoke out against the changes. Thus, through  economic and agricultural reforms with the help of his ministers the Tsar was able to solidify his rule. 

Lastly, his release of the October Manifesto and giving the people hope of government reform added on to his stability and validity as Tsar. The creation of the Duma’s gave the people a voice and a half chance at actually making some decisions for themselves though the tsar could still overrule any decision made brought the Kadets and Octobrists in line as they continued to vie for the Tsar’s attention to change anything. By the time the Fourth Duma was established the criteria for entry into the Duma was a great deal differed from what it originally was resulting in most of the people sharing similar views with the Tsar and in full support of him. The October Manifesto was countered by the Tsar’s own release of the “Fundamental Laws” shortly thereafter reminding the population just exactly who was in control and it was the Tsar not they. Furthermore, in 1914 neither the Bolsheviks nor the Mensheviks both halves of the Social revolutionary party were confident that they could mount a revolution and defeat the Tsar and for the time being refrained from any large attacks lest they be annihilated. Therefore, the Tsar’s position in 1914 wasn’t fragile yet quite stable. 

To Conclude, the Tsar’s position just before the outbreak of war in 1914 was quite stable with Russia having a good chance at becoming am fully industrialised country and the population being kept in check with the help of the army and existence of the Duma. Ultimately, the Tsar wasn’t in a fragile situation as the past would have suggested rather Tsardom and the Tsar emerged stronger and more solidified and were in a great place in 1914.
