“**The weak die out and the strong will survive, and will live on forever” — Anne Frank**

“The hellish landscape continued around for miles to be seen. No end in sight, no respite from the dreadful cold of the night nor the ferocious heat of the warmth, all to be seen and all that was once to be found in this barren world had been ripped away, torn to shreds.
The grim living remnants of humanity had banded together living alone in a nomadic society where survival of the fittest was key and fear rather than love was prized above all else.
In this unforgiving world where hope was all but lost is where we lived, a broken world a broken people with broken hearts and minds. If it wasn’t for it we wouldn’t be here still. Long ago we would’ve been exterminated and become a piece of history.”
But that isn’t what you have come here to learn, have you now. This is the story of how we found the book, the book that changed our world, the book that had given us hope after all was lost. The book([[More’s Utopia]]) that we continue to hold in reverence today.

It had been a long arduous slog through the day, searching for food, for shelter anything that could have saved us from another day of the endless sea of trials and tribulation([[The Odyssey]],[[Odyssey Notes]]). The rolling dunes surrounded us as we set up camp for the night with our meagre possessions. Oblivious to the events that would change the course of our lives.
