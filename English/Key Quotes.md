## Act I Scene ii
---
- Let him do his spite. My services which I have done the signory Shall out-tongue his complaints -- Othello
	- Demonstrates that Othello is a prideful man and he believes that his rank in the Venetian Army will save him from Brabantio's wrath. 
- Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. -- Othello
	- Telling brabantio's men to lay low their swords for he wishes to not fight them. He is an authoritative yet calm figure in the midst of violence -> Composure.
- My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. -- Othello
	- Again here we see Othello's full belief that his title and his actions will protect him from anything and everything that Brabantio can attempt to do against him. 
- Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be -- Brabantio
	- Demonstrates that racist way in which people viewed Othello and how he was an outsider to his own world and people. 
- O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter? -- Brabantio
	- Objectification of women, patriarchal ways of thinking. -› Women are property.

	- Overjoyed to see Desdemona 
- "When the blood is made dull with the act of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which the Moor is defective in" -- Iago
	- Othello here is once again marginalised, racial narratives. 
- "Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife," -- Iago
	- Iago believes has had an affair with Iago's wife Emilia. Amorous relations and he sees the opportunity to use Desdemona to exact his revenge. 
- "Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong" -- Iago
	- Put Othello into such a state of jealously that he loses his calm nature. 
- "For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too" -- Iago
	- Iago believes that Cassio has also had amorous relations with his wife. 
- "Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night" -- Othello
	- Cassio is in charge of the guard tonight which is Ironic as he is the one who will get drunk and lose reason. 
- "Honest Iago" -- Othello
	- Epithet and Dramatic Irony as Iago is everything but honest.
- I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio -- Iago
	- Equivocation used to imply something. Essentially admitted that Cassio has done the wrong thing. Telling truth but in an ambiguous manner
- "Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter" -- Othello
	- Epithet and Dramatic Irony as Iago is everything but honest.
- "And passion, having my best judgment collied," -- Othello
	- First indication that Othello is losing control over his behaviour and his actions. First step towards animalistic behaviour.

	- Bemoaning the loss of his reputation as he has just been demoted. 
- "Confess yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your place again" -- Iago
	- Iago advises Cassio to appeal to Desdemona using the same language he uses to characterise her that he does to show Othello at the beginning of the play. 
- "So will I turn her virtue into pitch, And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all." -- Iago
	- Manipulating Desdemona to everyone around her, suggesting that Desdemona is the opposite of virtuous. 

## Act III 
---
- Promises Cassio that he will take Othello out of the way for a while and gets Emilia to talk to Cassio. 
- "Ha! I like not that" -- Iago
	- Sows seeds of doubt into Othello's mind.

	- Essentially saying that if Othello is not angry/jealous with Desdemona he will live his life with his wife sleeping with other men. 
- "Haply, for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have," -- Othello
	- narratives of race coming into doubt for Othello, 
	- he has internalised these thoughts and he thinks he's less than what he truly is, he is starting to believe the narrative thrown at him by all those around him.
