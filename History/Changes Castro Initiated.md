> #history 



- Post Revolution Castro began to install many changes that could be considered as transforming the country into a communist state. 
- Despite this he did make changes that were benefits to the majority if not all of the citizens currently living in Cuba. 
	- Improved Health care and reduced the huge discrepancies between private and public sector. 
	- Made health care free and by 1962 allocated 4 times as much funding towards healthcare services compared to Batista. 
	- Took the infant mortality rate from 13th highest in the world in 1958 to the lowest in 2009. 
	- Banned private education and made school free for all. 
		- Resulted in major decrease in illiteracy rates. 25% in 1959 to 4% in 1970
- Land Reforms can be seen as his movement towards communism 
	- Large landowners were deprived of their land and and an institute of agrarian reform was creating with the main purpose of breaking up the land and distributing it amongst the entire population so that no one had more than 100 acres of land at any given time. 
- He also failed to properly transform the economy resulting in a mass exodus of the nation’s middle and lower upper class consisting of people such as doctors, teachers and professors leaving the country in a “Brain Drain”. 
- Relied too heavily on Soviet Investment leading to the leaving of the US simply becoming a transfer of masters for Cuba. 

### Why did opposition grow against Castro
---
The combination of failed economic policies and increasing authoritarianism and a sense of disappointment and discontent amongst the population led to the growth of opposition. The discontent was majorly amongst groups that had been affected in a negative way from Castro’s policies. Landowners, artists, writers and people who were concerned about the way the government was taking shape were amongst the most outspoken against Castro. 

### How Did he Overcome it
---
The Opposition was never a united, organised body and the disaffected groups were unable to join their efforts together to gain some significant movement against Castro’s rule. Cuba’s close knit society was exploited by Castro’s security agency the DGI to disassemble attempts and movements against him before they could be properly started.
