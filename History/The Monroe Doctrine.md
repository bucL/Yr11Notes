 # *Introduction and Strategic importance of Cuba*
---
Pro slavery lawmakers want to buy Cuba from Spain and enslave its people anti slavery political movements defend Cuba. Debate in America as America considers whether it should become a European style imperial power or a more conservative country that respects it as a fellow Sovereign. America Establishes a Quasi Independence over Cuba in 1898 America still has some control over Cuba but otherwise generally lets it remain free and continue its interests Communists win in 1959 and Castro takes control. 

## Reasons for American Interest in Cuba
---
- Consisted of fertile and rich soil that was good for the growing of crops such as sugar and pro slavery states want to exploit this and the population.
- Anti Communism sentiment expressed by the people of the USA. 
- Sugar Imports and trade.

1. The image suggests the overwhelming political power the USA possessed over other countries in the region and the idea that America should continue its expansion outward like European Imperial Countries. Suggests the increase of trade if it does so.  
2. Cuba is depicted as being a part of America just another colony, a part of the United States. 
3. Is positioned on the USA's southern flank and provides access to the Gulf of Mexico and beyond into the Caribbean and Southern America.

Much of the USA's prosperity and Economic growth relied upon the geography of the central United States and the region's unique characteristics features. The fertility of the soil and placement of waterways that eventually led to an exit in the gulf of Mexico which could be accessed by the Mississippi River and the Mississippi Delta. Cuba's own geographical position landed it almost directly within the centre of both the US and Mexico. To cripple to USA's economy entirely and impose great suffering upon the heartland of America an enemy would not as previously before tried by the British try to choke the exit of the Mississippi River as it was heavily within American Territory rather it could use Cuba's strategic position and block off the exit to the Atlantic ocean creating a chokepoint and blocking off the US from any further trade. Causing severe logistical issues for the United States as it failed to export any of its produce to the world at large. 

# The Strategic Importance of Cuba
---
	- Cuba is located **144km** from US Coastline (Florida)
	- It is of strategic importance as it:
		- is the gateway to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean
		- The bulk of US farming exports are shipped through the Mississippi delta
		- Has the potential to expose souther US defences to a strong navy. 

# The Monroe Doctrine
---
- In 1823 US President James Monroe articulated a policy which outlined the United States' policy on the **new political order** developing in the Americas. 
	- Developed in conjunction with Secretary of State John Quincy Adams.
	- A disentanglement from European affairs. 
	- Provided a clear outline that the US would dominate affairs in the Americas.
	- Any future act of colonisation by European powers would be seen as an act of aggression requiring US intervention. 
	- This document became the driving force of US foreign policy for over a century. 
	- The United States was looking to expand alongside Russia at this moment in time. 

```
The American continents are... henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonisation by any European powers

- Monroe Doctrine 
```


## What are the key features of the Monroe Doctrine?
---
- The American continents are now free and they are not to be messed with by the European powers. 
- If anyone tries to come back and take over one of these small independent countries the United States will take this as an act of aggression 
- The Monroe doctrine would be meaningless without British support -- they were still the boss. 
- The U.S. claims to be the sole power in the 'new world'. 
- Latin America loves the U.S.
- Monroe Doctrine is used as justification to add future land like Texas, California and even Hawaii.

The U.S. is now taking a lead role the "new world".
