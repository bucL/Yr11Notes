"It would be impossible to give even a rough estimate of the beggar population of Cuba but it is considerable, as anyone who has visited Cuban cities can testify. Large numbers of them are women... They are found at the gates and on the steps of the churches on a Sunday morning, begging alms of the churchgoers.

From  A Perez, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution, 1998.

1. The Source is describing the state of Cuban cities and the number of displaced and homeless people that have become beggars due to a lack of availability of food as women were lined up "on the steps" of churches "begging alms of the churchgoers". Mass poverty is being described along with the mistreatment of the people by the Cuban government, 
2. The Source reflects the policies of the Batista government in a negative light and demonstrates how they were geared towards making the rich, richer and the poor, poorer. Shows disparity between support given to the poor vs the rich. 
3. This Source is useful for a historian studying economic conditions within Cuba as it shows the Mass Poverty and homelessness present within 1950s cuban society and the disparity between the possessions of the rich compared to the poor. It also demonstrates how policies during this time period were geared towards supporting the rich and ignoring the poor.

"I was enchanted by Havana - and appalled by the way that lovely city was being debased into a great casino and brothel for American businessmen over for a big weekend from Miami. My fellow countrymen reeled through the streets, pick up fourteen-year-old Cuban girls and tossing coins to make men scramble in the gutter. One wondered how any Cuban - on the basis of evidence - could regard the United States with anything but hatred."

From  A Perez, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution, 1998.

1. The Source is describing the overpowering influence that Americans and American Businesses had in Cuba and demonstrates how Havana had been transformed from a place of Sanctity and relative freedom to an American Businessman's backyard. 
2. The author has a negative attitude towards American actions in Havana as he does not support their transformation of the City into a gambling centre and an American Businessman's playground. 
3. American owned businesses owned 90% of the mines, 40% of the Sugar Productions and 100% of the Oil Mines. 
4. This Source is useful in understanding the reasons why batista became increasingly unpopular as it describes the ever increasing economic downturn experienced by pooer cubans under batista.
