Debate in America as America considers whether it should become a European style imperial power or a more conservative country that respects it as a fellow Sovereign. America Establishes a Quasi Independence over Cuba in 1898 America still has some control over Cuba but otherwise generally lets it remain free and continue its interests Communists win in 1959 and Castro takes control.

Much of the USA's prosperity and Economic growth relied upon the geography of the central United States and the region's unique characteristics features. The fertility of the soil and placement of waterways that eventually led to an exit in the gulf of Mexico which could be accessed by the Mississippi River and the Mississippi Delta. Cuba's own geographical position landed it almost directly within the centre of both the US and Mexico. To cripple to USA's economy entirely and impose great suffering upon the heartland of America an enemy would not as previously before tried by the British try to choke the exit of the Mississippi River as it was heavily within American Territory rather it could use Cuba's strategic position and block off the exit to the Atlantic ocean creating a chokepoint and blocking off the US from any further trade.
