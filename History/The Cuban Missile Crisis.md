## Cause
---
- Hostility between Cuba and the US led to increased political and economic relations with the Soviet Union which further provided them with aid in the forms of economic boosts and military supplies. 
- The Soviet Union promised to provide Cuba with increased defence weapons including a number of medium and long range nuclear armed missiles in July 1962 after a meeting with Raul Castro,
- Khrushchev believed that through the missiles the US would leave Cuba to its own devices as any attack there directly impeded upon the Soviet Union and would help defend Cuba. 

## Course 
---
- Ensuing time period compressed of six tension filled days as the United States discovered the existence of the missiles through a spy plane and thought of it as an act of war. 
- Kennedy instated a '*quarantine*' or naval blockade to prevent missiles from coming into Cuba on Monday 22 of October 1962. 
- Day after Kennedy's address Castro mobilised the army and local militias as a response to Kennedy and ordered them to take up defensive positions all around Cuba. 
- On 26 October Khrushchev agreed to take out the missiles if Kennedy took out the American missiles from Turkey and pledged to not invade Cuba.
- Kennedy readily agreed and on 28th October the missiles were removed. 
- Castro was furious as he had not been consulted about any of this and as a result Cuba was viewed as not having achieved independence rather simply changing masters. 

## Impacts
---
- Kennedy Restored his reputation from the Bay of Pigs failure.
- Khrushchev was perceived as weak by his colleagues for failing to stand up to Kennedy and the humiliation he suffered became the catalyst for his political demise in October 1964.
- Kennedy and Khrushchev demonstrated incredible restraint and responsibility which would have led to the most dangerous and direct conflict in the cold war. 
- Castro suffered no loss in popularity for his role in the crisis but was now alert to the dangers of being embroiled in international politics
- US and the Soviet union established a "*hotline*" teleprinter link and Nuclear arms control talks started. In August 1963 a Test Ban was signed between America, Russia and Britain
- WW3 was avoided by the nearest of margins.

1. The two personalities are John F Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. 
2. The cartoon implicates that both sides had the option to blow each other up at once if the wished to do so but the destruction of one would most certainly lead to the destruction of the other as well.
3. The cartoon suggests that political and international tensions at the time were high as can be seen through the sweat pouring off Khrushchev's face and Kennedy's look of strain and struggle.
