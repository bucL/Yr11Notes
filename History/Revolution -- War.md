## Lessons of the 1905 Revolution

---

According to the source the 1905 revolution had failed because of the disunited and inexperienced protestors. Furthermore, the liberals backed out of the revolution and betrayed the workers by leaving them to be crushed by government troops. 

## Concessions

---

The Romanovs had survived their biggest challenge by granting concessions to its opponents. 

- Parliament — Dumas
- Political Parties legalised.

# Pyotr Stolypin

---

In July 1906 Peter Stolypin was appointed **Chairman of the Council of Ministers**. 

- Politically conservative and coercive.
- Suppression first and then, and only then, reform.

Attempted to introduce **land reform** to feed Russia’s growing population. 

- Cancel state owned mortgages to ‘de-revolutionise’ the peasantry.
- Urged farmers to abandon **strip system farming.**
- Failed to win the support of a suspicious peasantry

Fierce repression of opposition. 

- Introduction of martial law and military courts.
- Between 1906 - 1911 conductions 2500 executions, “Stolypin’s necktie”.

Assassinated in 1911

Overall Stolypin’s represents change in the nature of the Romanov’s rule as he made significant progress in improving the rights of citizens. He made all royal and government land available to purchase for enterprising peasants and created a credit system to be able to purchase land and buy new equipment. Introduced compulsory primary education for all peasants. Tried to create a wealthy peasant class to increase agricultural output and exports to put the money gained back into the industrial economy.

## Research Task — Why was the first Duma unsuccessful?

---

The First Duma was established in May of 1906 after the Tsar released the Fundamental Laws further stating his total control over Russia. The Duma consisted of mainly Kadets and Social Revolutionists who despite their reluctance to bring forth a revolution to overthrow the tsar still wanted political and land reforms that would give the people more control and freedom over their lives. They also demanded the release political prisoners kept by the tsar. The Tsar not wanting to give up any shred of his authority denied these requests and shortly thereafter the Duma was dissolved after it passed a vote of ‘no confidence’ in Prime Minister Ivan Goremykin. The Tsar absolutely did not want any questions asked of his authority in the Duma.
