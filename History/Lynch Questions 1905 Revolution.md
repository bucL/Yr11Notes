1. The 1905 revolution didnâ€™t follow a pattern but rather it was a series of revolution held all over Russia that ultimately led to the removal of the Tsar. The only main form of organised rebellion was when Paul Milyukov who led the Kadets persuaded the other liberal groups to form a Union of Unions with the aim of organising a broad alliance that would include the peasants and factory workers.  
2. The mutiny was a serious threat to the Tsarist Regime as a government that cannot rely on its soldiers and sailors to be loyal and aid it particularly during a time of war is very vulnerable to succumb to the opposition and showed just how deep the contempt for the Tsar ran. 
3. The Tsarist government took steps to pacify its people by appealing to each group in turn. To the liberals they created the October manifesto which made the following concessions
    1. the creation of a legislative duma
    2. freedom of speech, assembly and worship
    3. the right of political parties to exist. 
    4. the legalising of trade unions
    
    Next were the peasants by an announcement in November that said the mortgage payments which were due were to be progressively reduced and then abolished altogether. This saw a rapid decrease in the number of land seizures by peasants and a lack of general lawlessness in the countryside. 
    
    For the industrial workers the government simply crushed them with the returning army invading their headquarters in St Petersburg and arresting and killing them all.
