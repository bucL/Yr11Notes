#### Task Fidel Castro: The Early Years and Batista's Cuba

###### What key qualities did Fidel Castro display in his early years as an effective leader?
In his early school years Fidel demonstrated excellent qualities of leadership and argumentation through his background in debating. He grew up on his fathers sugar plantation and as a result was exposed to the harsh realities of Cuban life from a very young age which influenced his political career later on. He entered the University of Havana to study law and his experiences allowed him to develop his political leadership skills for the future. His university life was marked by the violence of student political activities and politics which quickly gained him a group of supporters who admired his speaking skills, extraordinary memory and leadership skills. 


###### Account for the rise of opposition to Batista's power. 
As Batista's rule continued on many became dissatisfied with the increasing corruption, dictatorial and brutal demonstrations of power from his government. Arrest and imprisonment without trial became commonplace as the people sought for a peaceful solution to allow public elections once again. Their peaceful and legal means to restore constitutional government failed Cuban radicals decided that the only way forward was through armed struggle. The Batista regime used violent measures to quash any opposition to his authority creating significant social unrest. Ramón Bonachea describes a situation where a group of young youths ran onto the field int he midst of a national baseball game being streamed on live television holding signs saying "Abajo Batista!" ("Down with Batista!") and thousands watched on television as the police savagely beat the unarmed youths.
