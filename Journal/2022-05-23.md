yay first one of these with new mechanical keyboard. it actually feels very nice and i'm thinking about modding it with foam very soon to maybe get some more *thock* and reduce the keyboard pings even tho that isn't a huge problem on this keyboard. anyhow otherwise things are travelling fine getting maths marks back tomorrow and while thats kinda scary hopefully it will be a decent mark hoping for above 85% figures crossed. Started rereading cradle series again just hoping that will wight releases dreadgod sooner rather than later. otherwise things are going well next assignment/test that is due is the ext 1 maths test on the 15th of June and then immediately after english as well. Might get a start on the physics project proposal you never know. English is going alright finished analysing [[Act III]] and [[Act IV]] last week and now we've moved onto sax's version of Othello didn't finish the math homework today tho, its fine i'll finish it tomorrow when I get back from badminton. dumb wrist injury still hasn't healed and I can only hope it heals soon enough for me to get back at it again. [[Cuba Term 2]] study is going good just finished [[Consolidation of Power]] for Fidel Castro and reasons why the US pursued to kill him after discovering his inner communist sentiments. that's it I guess, a lot has happened but I wouldn't be able to tell you about half of the stuff that goes on inside my brain.
