Shakespeare uses Iago's machiavellian nature to coincide narratives of race and gender to instil seeds of doubt and vacillate Othello's sentiment of Desdemona to create chaos within the play. We see this in Act III where he continuously casts doubt on Desdemona's fidelity to Othello. Iago says "She did deceive her father, marrying you" deliberately echoing Brabantio, using language to manipulate and position Othello into a state of constant paranoia and doubt until he himself starts to believe that narratives of Race present in his society. Iago goes on to say "Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion and degree" implying that it is natural for people to be attracted to those of their own race reinforcing this statement with the use of a Tri-colon. Iago's statements serve as reinforcement for Othello's position for an outsider which he accepts why he begs the question of Iago "why did I marry" serving as a premonition for the terrible acts Othello commits to come. As Othello internalises narratives of race his language starts of reflect that of Iago shifting into prose. Thus, Shakespeare uses Iago's insidious duplicity to create narratives of race and gender that converge to create chaos within the play.
