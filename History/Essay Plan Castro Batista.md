>Judgement: To a significant extent 


This statement is accurate to a significant extent as the pre-exisiting situation present in Cuba itself and Batista's continued ignorance of the state of his people and the conditions present for revolution led to his downfall, Castro simply made his appearance at the right time in the right place allowing his voice to be heard. This is demonstrated through the initial lack of concern Batista held for his rule leading to the deprecation of his country which fell into a general state of disarray and decay. Additionally, while the rest of the revolutionary movement  inspired by Castro's initial charge on the Moncada barracks kept up the pressure on the Batista government forming underground societies and taking control of major cities for days at a time, while Castro and his trained party of fighters were crushed by Batista forces and retreated into the mountains emerging only when Batista doomed himself to fall due to his incapacity as a leader. Ultimately, Fidel Castro did not win power in Cuba, rather he waited for the opportune moment and seized control after Batista's fall.
