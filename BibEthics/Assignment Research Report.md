#### What is it?
At its simplest level artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It is the ability of a computer or a computer controlled robot to perform tasks generally associated with intelligent beings.  These include things such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalise and the most common form used learning from past experiences. Intelligence in this situation must include the ability to adapt to an ever-changing environment.  


#### How does it apply to the workforce?
AI is increasingly becoming apparent as the next big thing in the workforce people will no longer have to conduct mundane tasks such as sorting through emails and responding to customer’s or even pick up telephone/communications calls as AI leading to a severe cut in the amount of jobs currently held by people yet an equally substantial increase in the number of jobs for roles

#### Perspective 1: Employee’s Standpoint
From a company employee’s standpoint the introduction of AI into the workforce is both a good and a bad thing depending on which sectors are targeted by the company they work for. From a frontend employee’s point of view someone who works with clients the introduction of AI into the workplace is as negative as it replaces them and their job essentially leaving them jobless or being reassigned to a different part of the company

#### Perspective 2: Employers Standpoint
From an employers’ standpoint the introduction of AI into the workforce is a huge plus as it removes the need for many previously existing jobs that would all have salaries attached to them is gone and can transfer into maintaining the software solution. This would result in increased profits for the company and a decrease in the amount of support they would need to provide for their employees.

In terms of “**Consequentialism**” the morality of implementing AI into the workplace casts doubt on its implementation. This is because as a consequence of implementing AI there would be hundreds if not  thousands of jobs being replaced across all sectors of major companies leaving many jobless and struggling to pay for their bills. This would then lead to a decreased standard of living and less diversity in the workforce. Therefore in terms of consequentialism the implementation of AI into workforce. 

In terms of “**Utilitarianism**” the implementation of AI into the workforce would result in a benefit for all. Utilitarianism is the doctrine that actions are right if they are useful or for the benefit of a majority. When AI is implemented into the workforce the majority, the clients, benefit greatly as they have reduced service times easy access and further benefits. 

# Section 4

In terms of the bible it says nothing about the implementation of AI. 

# Section 5

Therefore to conclude, the implementation of artificial intelligence in the workforce is a severe issue that needs to be looked at in more detail by experts and be decided upon if it is worth the loss of a couple hundred or thousand jobs for the benefit of all or not.
