## Analyse how Othello's position as a cultural outsider is established in the opening act 
--------
Othello's treatment by Roderigo and Iago as well as Brabantio's outrage at his marriage to his daughter establishes his position as a cultural outsider in the the opening act. Introduced in the opening scene through racial epithet's, called "Moor" and "thick lips" Othello is never named in the opening scene and is given an animalistic perception excluding him from society. The slurs are deliberately used to diminish him and represent the dominant ways of thinking at the time. Moreover, Brabantio's outrage at Othello's marriage with his daughter further solidified Othello's position as a cultural outsider in Venice. Brabantio uses degrading language when he says "Of such a thing as thou", dehumanising Othello and implying that he is not human demonstrating the world and its values that Othello must contend with. Furthermore, he labels Othello "foul" and "Sooty" indicating the racial stance held against Othello by the people of the time consolidating his position as a cultural outsider. Ultimately, Othello's position as a cultural outsider, a "moor", is established through his treatment by others.
