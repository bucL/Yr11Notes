# Ethics
---
Can be defined as ;

>***"A system of moral principles by which human actions, speech, thought and proposals may be judged good or bad, right or wrong."***

Often describes the investigation and analysis of moral principles and dilemmas. 

Traditionally philosophers and religious scholars investigated ethics but more recently scholars from various disciplines have entered the field, creating new approaches such as **behavioural** and **applied** ethics. 

Can also refer to rules or guidelines that establish what conduct is right and wrong for individuals and groups. Eg. Codes of Conduct for medicine, journalism, law and accounting.
