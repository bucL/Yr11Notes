“When I look back, I am so impressed again with the life-giving power of literature. If I were a young person today, trying to gain a sense of myself in the world, I would do that again by reading, just as I did when I was young.”

Stimulus quote.

When I sit down and begin to read a book that feels like it weighs as much as a hippo or an elephant, it always fills me with a sense of dread and fear for oh how could I ever glimpse every word, read every character and summon every character’s name on demand in this titanic tome of knowledge. I feel like I’m Dante standing at the foot of the mountain of heaven only to be told that I must face all the fear and dread that those before me have as me have as well and set off into unknown and uncharted waters facing sea serpents, sirens and the wrath of all powerful gods just to find my way home. Or am I trying to find myself and what things really symbolise in this time of ever-changing politics and social situations is when I find myself turning to literature and this wonderful world of knowledge. The way a book or a piece of text can transport you into a world that is completely different from your own is just amazing. There’s so much knowledge and wisdom to be gained from them I find it astonishing that I didn’t pick them up earlier. Looking back now I really believe that books have really helped me shape person I am today. This power of literature that gives life to characters and guides, people like Virgil that guided Dante through the darkest places he had seen in his life. Literature helps me gain a sense of myself in the world and I turn to it whenever I feel like I’m losing myself.

I used to love reading books, I used to love just getting lost in that endless sea of uncertainty not knowing what would happen, where I would be or end up after hours of trekking across a perilous wasteland filled with things beyond description or sailing across the seven seas trying to find a way to get home.
