> [!quote] "If we had paused to tell the people that we were Marxist-Leninists while we were on Pico Turquino and not yet strong, it is possible that we would never have been able to descend to the plains"

## Fontaine - Reading

#### Political:
- After seizing power the  new revolutionary government fell into serious infighting leading to the resignation of the Prime Minister Miro Cardona 
- Although he had promised to conduct free elections within the first 18 months following his takeover of Cuba these were indefinitely postponed as he justified his address by saying "Elections? What for?" thus becoming a dictator himself. 
- Suspended the 1940 constitution and its guarantees of fundamental rights, governing by decree until 1976. 
- In the fall of 1960 the last few remaining political leaders of any opposition to Castro's rule were either shot and killed or fled the country to escape.
- Castro quickly and methodically removed any and all opposition to his rule immediately after coming into power. 
- People of every race were fleeing Cuban Socialism as daily life became increasingly intolerable. 
- Thousands of Cubans mobbed the Peruvian embassy in Havana in April 1980 in the Mariel crisis demanding visas to escape the country. Castro only allowed 125000 to get through and filled those spots with mainly criminals and the mentally ill or the poorest people of Cuban Society those who were supposed to be cared for by the government. 
- The massive exodus was a demonstration of the regimes failure to keep its people content 

#### Social: 
- Instantly after gaining power Castro and his companions executed 600 of Batista's supporters and officials in government roles. 
- Agricultural reform launched on 17 May 1959
- The only newspapers left after 1960 of Castro's takeover were Communist Grunma (Grandma named after the ship he took to Cuba from Mexico) and Hoy (Today. )
- At the end of 1960 a massive exodus took place in which nearly 50,000 people from the middle classes many of whom who had initially supported Castro left the country as they differed in views to the current government. 
	- This exodus of teachers, lawyers and doctors did irreparable harm to Cuban Society.
- Any Cuban could be arrested on the spot if the authorities believed that he or she presented a danger to society even if that person had done nothing to cause harm. 
- Law against Absenteeism was passed in March 1971. 
- In the 1961 many Cubans began to vote with their oars as fishermen and other people with access to their own boats and supplies began to flee the country. 
- In the summer of 1994 violent riots occurred in Cuba for the first time since 1959 as people became increasingly upset with the way things were being managed by the government

> [!quote] In 1958, the public sector consisted of 7567 primary schools, 17,355 teachers and 717,417 students. data from 1962 shows that there had been an increase of 6213 public primary schools, 19258 teachers and 489,869 students. This expansion of the education system meant that by the mid 1960s the literacy rate had risen from 70 to 90 percent and in 2009 had reached 99.8% dramatically higher than any other Latin-American Nation.

## Transformation
---
> [!quote] "Cuban leaders vowed to modernise the economy and overcome the islands historic dependence by diversifying agriculture and promoting industrialisation.... Cuba intended to do it simultaneously with a revolution that was redistributing the country's wealth and resources."
> -- Chomsky, 2011, p.50

## Economic Policy
---
- Large landowners were deprived of their land and an institute of agrarian reform was created with the main purpose of breaking up the **latifundia's** (The cuban landowners' great estates) and 'returning the land to the people'
- The sugar industry, Cuba's major source of revenue was nationalised leading to increased productivity and accessibility for workers to find jobs. 
- Government subsidies were introduced in order to lower the rents and rates paid by the poor. 
- State investment was directed into Cuba's infrastructure to improve communications and public services, including communal housing in urban areas. 
- Plans to redistribute income and raise workers' wages were introduced. 
- To save on expenditure cuts were made in the imports of food and consumer goods.
- Rationing was introduced to lessen food shortages. 
- Castro's initial plan was to diversify the Cuban economy so that it wasn't entirely dependant on sugar but he soon realised that this was unworkable due to bad weather and the climate of the area. 
	- A large number of the skilled managers had left during the Cuban brain Drain due to Castro's policies. 
	- Led to Cuba becoming a sugar based economy for much of Castro's era. 
- Castro tried to go back to sugar but his earlier actions created problems as much of the sugar cane had been destroyed and the soil ploughed to prepare for the new crops. 
- Relied too heavily on Soviet investment. 
- He wanted to reach the symbolic goal of the 10 million ton harvest but his push to achieve this goal led to severe damage of the land. 
- Lack of innovation as a result of agricultural policies. 
- Castro's failure to transform the Cuban economy, increasing authoritarianism and a growing sense of disappointment with the way the revolution was working in practice led to the growth of opposition.
