1. Outline how Russia’s economy was damaged by WW1
    
    Russia’s economy suffered severe setbacks as foreign investments ceased to occur due to the war. Inflation was a massive issue as fuel and food quadrupled in price in the span of 2 years while land prices tripled by 1917. As a result there was a large famine in the Peasant population while it was much more difficult to feed the people in cities. The factories within the cities were also stagnated and more geared towards the war resulting in a drop of unique goods being manufactured and exported/used. Furthermore, conscription was another key factor in the damage done to the Russian economy as millions of people were taken out of the labor force to serve in the army. 
    
2. Describe how the war disrupted the supply of food.
    
    War resulted in inflation which in turn then created a food famine for the population of Russia. Food prices increased substantially due to inflation and much of the food wasn’t able to be transported on time due to the army taking up all of the supply chains and transport lines. 
    
3. Explain the impact of Nicholas’ command
    
    Nicholas faced severe criticism as his war effort deteriorated and when he finally took charge of the war in August 1915 many didn’t believe that he had what it takes to change the outcome of the war. His taking over of the war effort made him directly accountable for all the difficulties and strategic failures made in the war resulting in the further diminishment of his popularity in Russia.
