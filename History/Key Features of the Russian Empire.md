## Politically Backwards

---

By the beginning of the 20th Century all major Western European countries had some form of democratic government. Extremism was encouraged through the denial of free speech. It remained outside the mainstream of European political thought with the Tsar's word remained final on all legal and governmental matters. There was no space for political debate and oppurtunities for political reform. Assassinations were common and 6 out the last 12 Romanov Autocrats were assassinated. The Russian Orthodox Church was split from other branches of Christianity in the 15th Century and was completely independant of outside influence. It was deeply conservative and opposed to political change. This resulted in many underground societies being formed as a result of the restriction of free speech. 

## Autocratic Rule:

---

A system of government where one person has absolute political power and sovereignty Eg. A King, Emperor or Tsar. Democracy is about the collective everyone votes for a particular person, party or group to be in power whereas in autocracy there is no voting or considering the choice of the public. In Russia the Tsar had complete autocratic rule over his people and had the final say in every single decision. 

## Russia’s Economy

---

Russia’s Economy was significantly underdeveloped compared to other European countries for its time. 82% of the population consisted of peasants, 12% Upper Class, 4% Working Class, 1.5% commercial class and 0.5% Ruling class. This is not to say that Russia did not have industry but the scale on which it was conducted was quite small compared to that of Great Britain and Germany. The sheer size of Russia also made it very difficult for materials to be transported as the next closest village could be anywhere from 4 hours to over a day away. This also led to Russia having a mostly agrarian economy with its people very dependant on agriculture and farming to put their next meal on the table.
