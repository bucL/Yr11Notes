# Russo-Japanese War — Causes, Impact & Consequences
---

As other nations in Europe + Japan industrialised, they grew wealthier and were able to support powerful modern militaries. Russia could not do this and meant that by 1890, their army was poorly equipped and lacked good transport which would lead to humiliating defeats in the Early 20th Century. 

## Causes

---

> *“... from the mid century onwards, and particularly from the 1870s until the start of the First World War, the major European powers, the United States and Japan eagerly sought to build up their imperial possessions. They were motivated by a range of factors: economics, idealism, glory, national prestige and misplaced racist theory...”*

### How does this image support or challenge commonly held expectations of war?

---

The image supports the expectation that people are merely pawns of the leaders and at their mercy. It also supports the idea of peace meeting and truces. It portrays war as a glorious pursuit and the idea Russia held that it would an easy war to win and they would just go and collect some more land.

## Motives

---

The Russian government had three main motives in going to war with Japan in 1904: 

- To pursue an expansionist policy in the Far East to compensate for its decline in Europe

> “*We need a small, victorious war to avert a revolution*” **Interior Minister — Plehve**
> 
- To distract attention from Russia’s domestic troubles
- To obtain an ice-free port.

## Task

---

### What caused the conflict?

Although the Japanese formally started the war, Aggressive Russian policies competing for property, land and influence in Korea as well Manchuria in Northern China provoked the Japanese. 

### Outline the Reasons for Russia’s defeat

Russia greatly underestimated the Japanese and poorly prepared. Although they had a much larger fleet many of their vessels were outdated and only a few could be categorised as modern at the time. Russia’s army suffered a huge mental blow after the initial loss at Tsushima and the morale of their troops was said to be reflective of the leadership of Nicholas II while Japanese soldiers were well-trained, professional and dedicated to their cause. 

### What implications did the defeat have for the Tsar?

The defeat resulted in a great blow for the Tsar whose public image stooped lower than before and further contributed to the revolution. The Tsar faced a massive Social and Political revolution growing back in Europe. 

### Analysing Sources

1.     The message the cartoon is trying to deliver is that the loss to japan in the small war was the last in a series of mistakes that would lead to the death of Nicholas II sooner or later. 
2. The fact that the cartoon originated from France has greater political implications as France and Russia were closely allied during the time and this image signifies France’s lowered confidence in Russia to be able to protect them from any threats should they appear.  


## Course and Outcomes of the War

---

**Russia severely underestimated Japanese strength:**

- Success of the Meiji Restoration — modernisation program.
- Japanese were far better prepared and equipped.

**A series of crushing military defeats humiliated Russia:**

- The Russia port of Port Arthur (Manchuria) fell to Japan in January 1905.
- The Russian Army was defeated at Mukden in March 1905.
- The Russia Fleet were crushed at Tsushima in May 1905 in just one hour after spending 8 months at sea.

**The Russians were forced to accept an embarrassing peace:**

- Withdraw forces from Manchuria
- Accept Japanese control of Korea and Port Arthur.

## Reasons for Russia’s Defeat

---

- Underestimation of Japanese Strength.
- Inadequate military planning.
- Poor Strategy.
- Japan’s readiness, skill and spirit. Agile effective fighting force. Japanese culture was geared towards victory at all costs.
- Lack of Modernisation.

## Source Analysis

---

1. The Source is from a Russian Perspective because of the Russian Writing and the fact that it is wrongly depicting the Battle of Port Arthur. 
2. This source is useful to a historian as it depicts the mindset of the Russians as they went in to the war against Japan for Port Arthur and how they believed that they would easily and surely defeat the Japanese and send them running, overconfidence.  Useful because it’s showing that the Russians are needing to censor and change events to maintain trust and popularity back at home. They needed to doctor events to remain in control. 
3. Not a reliable source as it is a false representation of events.

## Impact of Russia’s Loss

---

Russia’s loss to Japan resulted in the humiliation of not the soldiers but rather the government and military leadership whose poor performances further antagonised the growing dissent amongst the population leading to the direct challenge to Tsarist Rule, the 1905 revolution.
