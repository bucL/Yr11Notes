## How does Shakespeare reveal the power of cultural narratives to shape human relationships.  

Shakespeare reveals the power of cultural narratives to shape complex human relationships through ethnic stigma's and beliefs within society. This is demonstrated through his characterisation of Othello a black man living amongst the people of Venice in a society dominated by people of European origin. Iago's statement "very now an old black ram... is tupping your white ewe" illustrates the predominant ways of thinking of the time and how Shakespeare's own cultural narrative shaped the relationship between Iago and Othello. Iago's derogatory comments about Othello are in sync with the cultural narrative of the time and the idea of the colonial other that is separated from the rest of society. Narratives of race and gender become the tools that Iago exploits in order to achieve his desired end.
