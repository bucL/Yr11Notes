## The Rubric
---

- Undertaking the intensive close reading of quality texts from a variety of modes and media.
- Looking at different textual forms particularly poetry, prose, discursive pieces, etc.
- In doing so, they further develop the skills and knowledge necessary to appreciate, understand, analyse and evaluate how and why texts convey complex ideas, relationships endeavours and scenarios.
- Need to able to make judgments and evaluate the text. Judgements in terms of the value of the text. Not just I don’t like the text because its hard but rather the meaning of the text and what it means.
- Look at the construction of the text — Eg. Poorly constructed texts with contradictions.
- Need to explain how the form and textual features shape meaning.
- Looking into a new text that offers a new way of looking at the world, using a stream of consciousness throughout the book.
- Central to this module is developing student capactiy to respond perceptively to texts (considered response) through their own considered and thoughful writing and judicious reflection on their skills and knowledge as writers.
    - Understanding exactly what the text is saying whether its conceptual ideas or not
    - How is the text saying what it is to therefore reflect and challenge the values of its time and then how is the text doing that.
    - In A Simple plan Sam Raimi is reflecting and challenging the values of its time through the character of Hank and how he falls.
- Read texts that are engaging thematically, aesthetically, stylistically and/or to inspire or provoke them to critique skilfully, or to respond imaginatively. Through the study of texts, students develop insights into the world around them, deepen their understanding of themselves and the lives of others, and enhance their enjoyment of reading.
