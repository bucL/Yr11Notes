## What happened to the bodies of the tsar and his family? How do we know this?
In Yekaterinburg, Russia, Tsar Nicholas II and his family are **executed by the Bolsheviks**, bringing an end to the three-century-old Romanov dynasty and their bodies were buried close to their execution point. Initially we did not know where the bodies of the tsar and his family were not found until 1997 when all but one member Anastasia Romanov, one of the daughters were found but then later in 2007 her body was found as well next to the place where they lived.
