In India Currently, made a lot of progress on the software group assignment today and thats probably for the best since I won't have stable internet for the next couple of days. feeling slightly annoyed by mumma making fun of me at every opportunity she gets to see new people.  can't wait to go back home though it is nice here with amma. hoping to see the brighter side in the next few days. really close to a breakthrough with the jollycooks development project. thats all maybe i can do this daily from now on.
