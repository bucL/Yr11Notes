# Intro
*An iconic man, Winston Churchill went down in history as one of the greatest leaders of all time known for his provocative speeches and strategic intellect he played a key role in  Britain’s victory against Germany in World War 2. Despite his achievements in Britain and during times of war he was despised by many for his views on race that tarnished his image. Prior to his leadership in Britain’s WW2 campaign he played his part as a military commander in WW1 and served on the western front in Europe, before retreating into political exile as a part of his unpopularity for his views. During WW2, he exemplified the characteristics of a leader that were expected of a “great” man and was shaped by his experiences. Thus, Winston S. Churchill was a “great” man shaped by the turmoil of his life that ultimately left an everlasting legacy of matchless leadership yet it was tarnished by his conservative views on race.*  

# Para 1 →  Pre-WW2 → includes race views
Topic Sentence:
*Despite born into a rich aristocratic family  his early life was characterised by a series of disruptions(eg WW1 failure) that shaped his character prior to WW2.* 

Information:
- Early interest in the military led him to joining a group of cavalry in 1895
	- Gained fame during this time as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns and this is really the first time we see him use the power of words to convey a message → Link how it becomes important later on in WW2
- During world war one he was First Lord of the Admiralty → involved in the planning of the Gallipoli landings which saw heavy losses for the allied troops.
- following his failures he was demoted and served on the western front for the remainder of the war
- following the war he continued to immerse himself in politics → Member of the conservative party → influenced by his father who was a **tory radical and coined the term tory democracy** (Quinault R.E.)which upheld the supremacy of social order as it had evolved in english culture, eg. White supremacy.
	- Contributed to his views on race seen such as his opposition against the Indian push for independence and Mahatma Gandhi. 
- Evidence of this can be seen when he resigned from the shadow cabinet and began a passionate and at times hysterical campaign against the Government of India Bill (1935) designed to give India dominion 
- He exhibited a romanticised view of the British Monarchy(Jenkins). 
	- Formed key relationship’s with the monarchy Starting with King George V often at the expense of his own career and continuing on with his son George VI which became consequential in his appointment to prime minister in 1940.

Concluding Sentence:
*Ultimately, before his rise to prime minister in 1940 Churchill led a disseminated career in politics and an unfulfilling stint in the Royal military yet remained bitterly opposed to any who didn’t share his own views and committed wholly to sustaining British Dominance.* 

# Para 2 → WW2
> [!quote] “When opportunity presents itself don’t be afraid to go after it”
> – Richard Branson

Topic Sentece:
*Thus when faced with a dilemma on who to appoint as prime minister of Great Britain,  a person who could help them recover from the brink of defeat in WWII, out emerging from turbulence came Churchill. *

Information:
- Prior to WW2 he was wary of Hitler’s rise to power as early as the 1930s
- He was restored to his old position as First Lord of the Admiralty at the outbreak of the war due to his previous military experience and background.
- On May 10, 1940 Neville Chamberlain resigned as prime minister as Germany invaded the lower countries, looking past his anti-Socialism the depth of his commitment to defeat Hitler was eventually what convinced King George VI to appoint him. 
- It is during this time period we can see him shaped by the stresses by war and his true character shine as he rallied the allied troops through a series of speeches that sought to remind his people that hope still remained even in the darkest hour of the night. 
	- Jenkins Says that his speeches were “an inspiration for the nation, and a catharsis for Churchill himself”
- In coming to power he did not abuse the power of the British parliament yet while he always dominated the parliament with the force of his figure, he never neglected it or took it for granted. He would always prod and press the chiefs of the armed services yet never went against the collected judgement always taking in their decisions with acceptance. (Britannica)
	- It is perhaps for this reason and this reason only that WW2 was void of the domestic political intrigue that plagued World War I. 
	- For him the parliament was an instrument of public persuasion which he played like a master and drew strength and comfort from. 
- Despite his successes in the war he was unable to retain his position as prime minister in 1945 due to his conservative views and trust in his friend Lord Beaverbrook’s extravagant prophecies of the appalling consequences of a labour government.
-  After the war he strove to establish important alliances between the United States and Britain as well as one between Germany and France recognising the need for a solid foundation through which the world could begin to pull itself together. 

Concluding Statement:
*Ultimately, Churchill was a man shaped by the “stresses” experienced during his tenure as prime minister of Great Britain in World War II and proved himself a worthy leader and inspiration for generations to come despite his previous faults and misguided actions.*


# Para 3 → Legacy
Topic Sentence:
*For all his faults and talents  Churchill’s impact was to leave behind a legacy of success marked by failure and forged by the stresses he experienced as a leader.*

Information:
- He was a gifted journalist and a soldier of commitment and courage whose leadership talents and skill shaped the world to become what it is today. 
> [!quote] Whilst a romantic he was also a realist willing to consider what could be and what is
> - Herbert G. Nicholas.
- He was and is remembered for his oratorial prowess and his ability to play to the imaginations of his audience.
- Yet his legacy was marked with contradicting features as he struggled to  cope with the modern ways of thinking and his “Tory” (conservative) ideals. 
	- Demonstrated through his opposition against those who historically were marked lower in the historic social order. 
- Despite that his actions during WW2 and subsequent acceptance of the changing modern world negated 
- He accepted help from wherever it originated and did not discriminate against any who contributed to his cause. 
- Considered the Greatest briton of all time. 


 Concluding Statement:
 *Ultimately, Churchill’s legacy was one that we should remember for it is a story of how from the depths of failure one can rise to influence not only those around him but the world itself.* 




# Conclusion
Thus to conclude, while he surely had his faults as demonstrated by his conservative views on race exhibited by his passion to maintain the unjust social order that had existed for hundreds of years, Churchill was a leader, forged by the stresses of World War II and using those stresses to cement himself in history as one of the “great[est]” leaders the world had ever seen. He “emerged in a time of turbulence”(stimulus) to lead his country out of a desperate situation in a losing war to turn the tide to “catalyse” the necessary change needed by the outbreak of war and the importance of character.
