## Activity 2
1. The Untied States owned the majority of the Oil Refineries and a sector of Sugar mills and banks. American owned Businesses were spread all around Cuba with tourists being able to stay in American Hilton's, shop at Woolworths, and withdraw money at American National Banks. The majority of American Assets consisted of sugar factories, mines, oil refineries and other businesses belonging to American corporations all worth $1.8 billion in 1950s money now nearly $7 billion.  
2. On coming to power Castro appointed himself president of the national Tourist Industry, trying to encourage African American tourists to visit Cuba. He reduced the pay of Judges and politicians while raising that of low-level servants. He halved rents for those who paid less than $100 per month. He expropriated the Casino's and took properties taking hundreds of millions from mafia bosses. 
3. The American oil refineries and businesses refusal to process imported Soviet Oil was the first action that provoked Castro into taking major action against the United States. 
4. Castro  attempted to reduce the monopoly the US had by expropriating and nationalising businesses and assets owned by American Based companies or groups and restricted the maximum amount of land that could be owned by one singular person, group or entity to just 1000 acres. He seized assets that were worth $1.8 billion and in today's money nearly $10 billion dollars worth of Assets. 

## Activity 3
1. The view that Castro's social policies could be regarded as progressive is highly accurate as immediately after gaining power he started establishing policies and checks to ensure that the quality of life of the everyday Cuban citizen was largely improved.
2. These policies resulted in more classrooms and institutions for learning being opened in the 30 months following Castro's rise to leadership than hat had been accomplished in the past 30 years. Health Care was nationalised and expanded with rural health centres  drastically reducing the infant mortality rate. Within the first 6 months 600 miles of road were built around the country to account for the lack of proper infrastructure and subsequently saw a rise in trade across different parts of the nation. More than 800 houses were constructed each month to account for homelessness and rent was halved for the majority of low wage earners. The impacts of these policies were two-fold as it created great success amongst the rural and working class who praised Castro for his great leadership and restoration of the country but negatively affected the middle and upper classes which resulted in a nationwide "*brain drain*" as they migrated to Florida in the United States.  It also left the country severely underfunded and they had to take out major loans from partnering countries in exchange for natural resources such as sugar and crude oil.
