Othello gets into such a state of paranoia he has an epileptic fit. Symbolising a loss of control, a loss of control of his body and his mind. 

My lord shall never rest, I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience.
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift. -- Desdemona 

A woman's reputation is really important because once it is tarnished you cannot recover it. A woman was meant to be pure, if you were married you couldn't have affairs, you were the property of your husband. If the idea emerged that she was unfaithful, it looked bad of the man's reputation as well. "you can't control your wife". 

Iago is harnessing narratives of gender in order to achieve his vengeance and we see it in act III scene iii, deliberately casts doubt on Desdemona's virtuousness "ha! i like not that" suggesting she is up to something with Cassio, places that doubt in Othello's mind and the reminders of reputation and Othello's good name. All of these things become a means through which he can achieve what he wants. "She did deceive her father, marrying you," words here that Iago uses deliberately echoes brabantio's in the beginning of the play. uses language to manipulate and position Othello. Suggesting here that you cannot trust Desdemona, scene thereafter where she seems like she is doing something that she shouldn't be. Iago continuously casts doubt on Desdemona and we see the danger for women of the time (context). Get the idea of how cunning Iago is. Differing techniques of Insidious persuasion. Thoughts and words into Othello's mouth and head to create doubt in Othello's head. Othello is so deceived by Iago he responds "I am bound to thee forever", he believes that Iago is the only true person around him. Iago says "Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved. " -> mind games and dramatic Irony. Playing the role of a best friend. Othello then says "no not much moved", as doubt comes in he says "i do not think but Desdemona is honest" suggesting his doubt.  "Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime, complexion, and degree" Iago is implying that is natural for people to be attracted to people of their own race and rank, Again we see Iago reinforcing Othello's status as an outsider and that it is unnatural for Desdemona to be attracted to him, and as such it is more likely she would be attracted to Cassio instead, echoing Brabantio's words. Iago's cunning comes out and his insidious machiavellian nature through the words he speaks in this scene. Othello is now asking Iago to watch his wife. "Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless" Othello is now in complete doubt and doubts his wife.  

In Othello's vacillating demeanour towards Desdemona, he starts off doubting her and her behaviours but towards the end he denies all this. He starts to believe the narrative that she could not possibly love him because he's black and old. He also casts doubt on the nature of women "That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad". 

> [!quote] As Othello internalises narratives of race his language starts to reflect that of Iago. Shift of his language that reflects this change, he is taking on Iago's perspective, when it comes to himself and women

We see how much influence Iago has over Othello.
