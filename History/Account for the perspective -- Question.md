Use **Wright** reading and your own knowledge to account for the perspective in the source below. 


> [!INFO] > The corruption of the Government, the brutality of the police, the regime’s indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, for social justice and economic justice… is an open invitation to revoltion. 
> -- Arthur Schlesinger




The perspective of the source is one that incriminates the Batista government in its entirety and suggests that his rule was just one step away from complete and utter destruction. This perspective is supported by chapter one 'Fidel Castro's road to Power, 1952-1959' of Wright's paper "Latin America in the Era of the Cuban Revolution". In his paper Wright makes a statement that Castro's revolution was only able to occur because of the conditions that had directly preceded it "and the disrepute in which Cuba's political system and institutions were held." This quote directly supports Schlesinger's perspective and reflects the decayed state that Cuba had fallen into over Batista's rule. The fact that the sugarcane workers who were amongst the best paid in the entire region only earned less than a dollar a day further antagonised the people as they began to resent their leader and his empire. Despite the overall wealth of Cuba, the huge disparity between the rich and the poor left the people hungering for social and economic justice which led to their revolution. Ultimately, the perspective provided in the source incriminates the government as it had left the country in such a state of disrepair that they left the people no choice but to instigate a revolution.
