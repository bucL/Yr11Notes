***Read Russia by 1913: a stable nation or on the brink of revolution?- p.106***

1. **Key 'pulls' to each side of the debate?**
- Stable nation
    - Stolypin reforms had transformed the countryside and reduced impact of revolutionary parties
    - The war between Japan was a faded memory
    - Russia was establishing a strong relationship with Britain, steadily re-arming
    - Enormous economic improvement between 1906-1913 (reduction in annual debt,
    growth rate of over 6 percent which was highest in Europe)
- Brink of revolution
    - Political protests began to emerge due to Lena Goldfields massacre during 1912, tsarist troops killed 200 striking miners
    - Sharp increase of level of strikes between 1907-10, worker concentrated
    - Land reforms had a small impact on Russian economy, peasants preferred to work in communes rather than cities
    - Russia was still behind powerful industrial nations such as France, Germany, Britain

***The Balkans:***

- Most dangerous region in Europe at the time- South East
- Currently: Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Greece
- Previously under control of the Ottoman Empire but the 'slavs' wanted independence
- Throughout 19th century they began rising up against them - sometimes with support of Russia

**Reasons for Russian Involvement:**

- Timing: Russo and Japanese War and 1905 Rev

## **The Balkan Wars:**

---

In 1912 and 1913 there was two Balkan Wars which led to-

- Turkey almost completely pushed out of Europe
- Serbia doubled size and demanded freedom of other Slavs
- Austria feared Serbia's ambition and wanted them destroyed
- Slavic terroist groups, backed by Serbian authorities, planned to act against Austria
- By 1914 Russia was in a better state and would not back down as it had in 1908

## **Assassination of Franz Ferdinand:**

---

- Sarajevo - 28 June 1914
- The heir to the throne of Austro Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, was visiting Bosnia to observe the Army Corps
- 28 June. Archduke and wife were visiting Sarajevo - poor security, movements very well known

## **July Crisis:**

---

    - Serbians accepted most but not all of the terms in the ultimatum
    - Russia ordered the mobilisation of its forces, prep of war against Austria- Hungary
    - Germany followed suit by issuing declarations of war in late July and early August 1914

## **Reasons for Russian Involvement :**

---

    - Formation of the Franco Russian Alliance
    - Anglo Russian understanding
- Russia perceived itself as the protector if the Slavs people of the Balkans
    - Duty to protect Serbia against Austrian Intrusion
- Despite Russia being defeated by Japan in 1905 its military strength was widely regarded as formidable
    - Immense size and resources

    - Inability to provide strong central leadership

    - Attempt to rally the nation around him
    - Made him personally accountable for Russia's performance in the war
- Appointments were made by social standing not ability
- Information wasn't always passed on accurately to the Tsar

## Source Analysis

---

***Source Analysis- What does the source suggest about Nicholas' suitability to command the forces at the front?***

- Outlines his selfish and lack of care of his role and he was unfit for the role
- He doesn't show leadership and did not know anything about strategy and tactics
- Wasting time and not fulfilling his role

***Source
 Analysis- Interpretation of Failure: Using Source A and your own 
knowledge outline  Nicholas II role in the fall of the Romanov dynasty.***

- People sugar coated what the wanted to say- were afraid of expressing their thoughts
- Did not tell he full truth
- Lack of realism
- All these factors caused his collapse and the fall of the Romanov dynasty between 1914-1917

## **Overall Impact of the War:**

---

- Immediate impact was an outpouring of enthusiasm and patriotism
- Russian economy was unable to meet demands
- WW1 is exposing Russia to a larger extewant
- Desperate situation in Russia, through the combination of these factors

## **Russia's economy and WW1:**

---

**Severely damaged by WW1**

- Inflation (less available becomes more valuable)
    - 1914-16 price of food and fuel x4
    - By 1917, land tripled in price
- Food shortage
    - Famine in peasant
    - Difficult to supply cities
    - Transport used by military- inability to move key resources
    - Large influx of refugees to cities, increased pressure on food supply
- Transport
    - Lack of coordination meant precious supplies went to waste, didn't reach cities.
- Industrial Development
    - Stagnated and geared towards the war effort - **Total War.**
    - Decrease in working conditions — longer hours, decline in living conditions and overcrowding of the cities.
    - Development had been largely dependent on foreign loans — stopped with war.
