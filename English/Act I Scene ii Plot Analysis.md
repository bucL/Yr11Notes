Scene ii starts with Iago talking to Othello as he informs him of Brabantio's wrath against Othello for 'stealing' his daughter. This is the first sign of Iago's duplicitous Machiavellian nature. Othello responds, saying, 'Let him do his spite. My services... shall out tongue his complaints' which demonstrates his calm and composed air in complete contrast to the image of him painted in the opening scene. His demeanour is one that commands respect and we see an inversion of our expectations. Shortly thereafter Brabantio approaches and as a politician our expectations of his behaviour is that he should be the one that is calm and composed, yet he displays none of this and rather he is outraged, incensed and patriarchal in the manner in which he demands Othello return his "stolen property" to him. This statement epitomises the patriarchal ways of thinking and values of the time as Brabantio is referring to his daughter as property which was all women were thought of during Shakespeare's time.
