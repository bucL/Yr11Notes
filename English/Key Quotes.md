## Act I Scene ii
---
- Let him do his spite. My services which I have done the signory Shall out-tongue his complaints -- Othello
	- Demonstrates that Othello is a prideful man and he believes that his rank in the Venetian Army will save him from Brabantio's wrath. 
- Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them. -- Othello
	- Telling brabantio's men to lay low their swords for he wishes to not fight them. He is an authoritative yet calm figure in the midst of violence -> Composure.
- My parts, my title, and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly. -- Othello
	- Again here we see Othello's full belief that his title and his actions will protect him from anything and everything that Brabantio can attempt to do against him. 
- Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be -- Brabantio
	- Demonstrates that racist way in which people viewed Othello and how he was an outsider to his own world and people. 
- O thou foul thief, where hast thou stowed my daughter? -- Brabantio
	- Objectification of women, patriarchal ways of thinking. -› Women are property. 
- By Janus, I think no. -- Iago
	- 2 faced Roman God mythological allusion, machiavellian nature
