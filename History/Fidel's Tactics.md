##### Explain Wright's assertion that the tactics developed by Fidel were born "out of desperation rather than choice"(p.9) Wright Reading.
---
Wright's assertion that Fidel's tactics were created "out of desperation rather than choice" refer to the strategies employed by Fidel and his people to attack and bring revolution to Batista. He is referring to the fact that when Fidel originally returned to Cuba on a ship named "Grandma", many of his men became seasick on the way back to Cuba and due to an unfortunate storm they landed miles away from their intended location and 2 days late leaving them with no backup nor any guidance on where they could go which resulted in 15 out of the 82 men survived and fled into Sierra Maestra which was originally not planned for. This led to Fidel developing guerrilla warfare tactics of hit and run.
