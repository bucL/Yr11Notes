## 4.3 Father Gapon Quote

---

1. The language reveals that the workers while they are completely fed up with the way they have been treated by the Tsar they would still be willing to forgive him only if he would listen and finally grant them rights, better wages, better working conditions. If their terrible living conditions were to continue the workers would rather die than continue like they are right now. 
2. “Depotism and arbitrary whims” refers to the nature of the Tsar’s rule and his demands upon the population. 

## 4.4 Cartoon — The Czar of all the Russia’s

---

1. The cartoon suggests the Tsar is as good as dead in the eyes of the Russian people and is nothing more than a skeleton holding a staff wearing a coat pretending to be a ruler. 
2. The man standing at the Tsar’s feet depicts the working class begging the Tsar to change the law with a petition holding the paper in front of his face. It suggests that the living conditions for the working class during this period of time were less than satisfactory. 
3. The Cartoon suggests that Tsarist rule is slowly but surely killing Russia and all of its people, with the Tsar himself blind to the struggles of his people.
