> [!question] ##### Explain why the US continued to pursue options to topple Castro

The US continued to pursue options to topple Castro as they wanted to avoid letting the construction of a communist. state occurring so close to home, which was looking to be increasingly likely with Castro as the leader of Cuba. During the 1950s after establishing the Monroe Doctrine the US was under severe political tensions with Russia and as a result wanted to avoid anything that would let the Russians gain an advantage against them close to home. This was due to the Strategic Position of Cuba with it being only 144km away from the Florida Coastline and its ability to block any incoming or outgoing shipments into the Atlantic Ocean and further beyond. Castro during his time of rule before becoming a communist neither denied nor publicly supported the growing influence of the Cuban Communist part a notion that scared the US and which Castro knowingly used as a tool to gain leverage against the United States. Thus, the US continued to pursue options to topple Castro as they feared the creation of a Communist state in a country that was so close to home and which held great strategic value through its positioning at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico.
