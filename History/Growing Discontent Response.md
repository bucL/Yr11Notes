During the late 19th and Early 20th Century Russia was a politically backwards, underdeveloped and poorly managed country that was failing to meet the demands of its citizens. This resulted in growing discontent among the population who struggled to survive and live each day while the nobility and upper class were living it up and throwing parties left, right and centre. Ultimately, this resulted in growing discontent among the Russian Citizens by the time of the first world war. 

Russia in the 1900s was in a decline politically and socially. The nature of the Tsarist rule was autocratic, which is a system in which all the government and all the people owe their allegiance to one man only, not to their country but to the person leading the country. This led the majority of the people into believing that without their Tsar the country would fall into disarray and ruin. The Russian Orthodox Church was also in support of the Tsar and largely benefitted during his rule as they were the only church present in Russia at the time cut off from the rest of the world. The church even went so far as to proclaim that “God himself” demands that the Tsar remain in power and that his rule was holy. Furthermore, the percentage of the population that was part of the Ruling Class was highly disproportionate when compared to the Peasant Class with only 0.5% of the entire Russian Population being part of the ruling class and 90% of the population being peasants. The rule of the Tsar also resulted the denial of free speech which encouraged extremism and as a result many of the Tsarist Rulers were assassinated by members of underground societies that didn’t agree with the system of government. 

Russia’s large land mass and poor living conditions were another reason for growing discontent. The sheer size of Russia resulted in no firm transport system being established from one end of the empire to the other and often left entire towns and villages living in isolation. Even with the introduction of industrialisation into Russia in the early 1900s the majority of the population, 90%, were part of an agrarian economy that produced most of Russia’s income. This economy however was extremely underdeveloped leaving many of the peasants poor and in need food themselves. Russia’s harsh climate also had an impact on the agrarian economy with a very short growing season and poor quality soil the poor weren’t able to make a better living for themselves. Life in the cities wasn’t any better with large cities quickly becoming overcrowded and unsanitary, mould, mildew and rats were commonplace and severely impacted the liveability of the city. Working conditions were worse with 10-12 hours of work daily and constant risk of severe injure and no workers rights the people of Russia had plentiful reasons to be unhappy. The people were also increasingly exposed to new ideas through the liberal. Overall, the physical features of Russia’s empire greatly contributed to the growing discontent in the early 20th century. 

Lastly, Nicholas II himself was quite a poor leader who by himself was completely incapable of leading the Russian Empire. He was said to be a weak willed man with poor character and relied too heavily upon his advisors to make decisions for him. As a result he was easily manipulated and misled by those who would Russia’s downfall and ruin. 

Ultimately, Russia’s growing discontent was due to a poorly managed, underdeveloped economy and poor leadership decisions.
