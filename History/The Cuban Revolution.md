##### Source 7.7 and 7.11
Sources 7.7 and 7.11 reveal the "brutality of the police" and the oppressive manner with which the government treated its people. Source 7.7 says "the regime's indifference to the needs of the people for education, medical care, housing, social justice and economic justice" reveals the corruption of the government and the disconnect between the regime's ruler and his people. Source 7.11 reveals how the government had complete disregard for the will of the native cuban people and the transformation of a "lovely city" that was "being debased into a great casino and brothel" for American businessman and the negative influence America was having upon the people of America. 

#### Task Fidel Castro: The Early Years and Batista's Cuba

###### What key qualities did Fidel Castro display in his early years as an effective leader?
In his early school years Fidel demonstrated excellent qualities of leadership and argumentation through his background in debating. He grew up on his fathers sugar plantation and as a result was exposed to the harsh realities of Cuban life from a very young age which influenced his political career later on. He entered the University of Havana to study law and his experiences allowed him to develop his political leadership skills for the future. His university life was marked by the violence of student political activities and politics which quickly gained him a group of supporters who admired his speaking skills, extraordinary memory and leadership skills. 


###### Account for the rise of opposition to Batista's power. 
As Batista's rule continued on many became dissatisfied with the increasing corruption, dictatorial and brutal demonstrations of power from his government. Arrest and imprisonment without trial became commonplace as the people sought for a peaceful solution to allow public elections once again. Their peaceful and legal means to restore constitutional government failed Cuban radicals decided that the only way forward was through armed struggle. The Batista regime used violent measures to quash any opposition to his authority creating significant social unrest. Ramón Bonachea describes a situation where a group of young youths ran onto the field int he midst of a national baseball game being streamed on live television holding signs saying "Abajo Batista!" ("Down with Batista!") and thousands watched on television as the police savagely beat the unarmed youths. 

## Fidel Castro 1926 - 2016
Fidels father was a poor, Spanish economic migrant who had previously fought for Spain int eh Cuban War of independence. He set up a business growing sugar cane in Cuba. 

An illegitimate child, Fidel initially took his mother's last name and grew up alongside the children of his father's workforce. This experience, Castro later related, prevented him from absorbing "bourgeois culture" at an early age. 

He later was sent to various boarding schools and went on to study law. 

He stood for election in Cuba's national congress in 1952 but Batista's coup took place before the elections were held.

He later led Cuba from 1959 to 2008

### Fidel's Influences
Latin American nationalists such as Simon Bolivar and José Marti. 

He was familiar with the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin - However did not yet call himself a communist. 

Lenin's ideas inspired his plans for revolution and confirmed his belief that Cuba was hopelessly corrupt and unable to be changed through reform. The only path was revolution. 

Lenin advocated for violent, armed struggle to bring about revolution. His Bolshevik revolution in 1917 inspired many 20th Century revolutions. 


### Attack on Moncada Barracks
A failed attack in July 1953

Moncada is in Santiago -- 850kms from the Capital

Some of Castro's men were killed and 125 were captured 
- Half of them were executed
- The remaining half were sent to prison on the Isle of Pines

A new movement was born out of the attack -- July 26 movement or M-26-7

The 'History will absolve me' speech took place in 1953 -- it lasted 4-5 hours and became the movement's manifesto

Fidel and Raul Castro were released by Batista in 1955. 


### Key Points of Castro's Opposition
> [!Quote] The combatants of Moncada did not achieve their military objectives, but they did achieve their revolutionary objectives.  -- *Faustino Perez, Moncada rebel*

- While they were fleeing from the soldiers Fidel was prioritised by deputy force commander Abél Santamaria who said "Fidel... is the one who must not die". 
- Although only 3 rebels died 80 were captured and most of them were tortured for information and subsequently executed. 
- Batista was determined to set an example for future would be revolutionaries and in the aftermath thousands of people were ruthlessly detained and questioned. Anyone wounded even from an innocent accident was in danger of interrogation and torture. 
- Castro was captured on 1st of August 1953 By a patrol under command of Lieutenant Pedro Sarria. While originally ordered to kill Sarria took compassion on Castro and directed him to a civil prison first before being handed to the authorities. by then it was too late for execution and the public outrage at the government ensured that Castro would be subjected to humane treatment. 

> [!Quote] As for me, I know that imprisonment will be ... filled with threats, ruin and cowardly deeds of rage, but I do not fear it, as I do not fear the fury of the wretched tyrant who snuffed out the lives of 70 brothers of mine. Condemn me. It does not matter. History will absolve me. 
> -- Castro's famous speech in his own defence during his secret trial on 16 October 1953.
