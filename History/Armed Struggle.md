##### How is this an example of heroism & courage, fanatical dedication to a cause, method of struggle. 

Fidel's Sierra Maestra campaign is a story of determination and victory through sheer commitment to a cause. As described by the Argentinian Doctor Che Guerva "the physical conditions" of living as a group alone in the mountains with minimum contact with the outside world and the "spiritual conditions" of living under constant siege took their toll on Castro's men and their continued resilience despite the harsh and hostile environment contributes to Wright's Views.
