# Chapter 1
---
- Throughout the beginning sections of the novel there is a sense of doom and despair that is prevalent accompanied by the author's description of the landscape. 
- From the start the author establishes that the future that the man and his son live in, is one where little of the world as we know it still exists. Danger lurks and the man and his son are constantly kept on their toes as evidenced by the "*rearview mirror*" they place upon their cart.  
- He uses the continued symbolism and appearance of "*skeletal frames*" of human bodies and shapes of previous buildings are the world deteriorates. 
- There is this recurring concept of dreams for the father, dreams back to his youth and his past. 
- The idea that the boy is the only thing that is keeping him going. The child is symbolised as being the only "light" the man sees in this helpless world.  
- The Structure of McCarthy's text is also fragmented and doesn't follow a clear path from start to finish jumping in between different sections. 
# Chapter 2
---
- In this chapter the author further creates a link between the child and god calling him **"God's own firedrake"**, symbolising the fire within the man to keep going just for the boy. 
- In this chapter the imagery of the man's cough and his blood on the mist is a recurring theme as the man considers whether he will be able to make it to the coast before he has to kill the boy for his own good.
