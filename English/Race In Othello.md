# At the Beginning
---
Othello subverts the idea of race at the time by being civilised. 
- Shakespeare presents him as an incredibly articulate individual

Shakespeare is complicating our one dimensional perceptions/views of race. Because Othello is not what the audience expects. 

- Introduced in the opening scene through racial epithet's -> called "thick lips"
	- Deliberately used to diminish him
- Roderigo + Iago open the scene. 
	- Roderigo has been paying Iago money to "woo" Desdemona for him. 
	- Use racial slurs and epithets to talk about Othello
	- His **NAME** is never used in the opening scene. 
- From the beginning Othello is introduced as a *cultural outsider*
- Representing the dominant ways of thinking
	- Name European. 
	- If you are not then they are characterised as the colonial other. 
		- Made Desdemona's father Brabantio Unhappy. 
			- Brabantio = Senator
