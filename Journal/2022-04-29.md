Today Was the last day of the first week of Term, so far I think school's been going pretty well i've managed to stay on-top of most things though art is starting to become quite the challenge. Maths is going alright I'm slowly but surely getting there going to see tutors next week for some further help. Software is going really well and I'm enjoying it quite a lot.
